	<li>The client is allocated dedicated resource(s) along with the necessary functional support staff such as a Team Leader or Project Manager if requested (based on the service commissioned).</li>
	<li>The developer/ designer is on a dedicated basis; it is important he or she has tasks at all times to avoid delays (any delays may increase the time required to complete the project).</li>
	<li>The client is allocated dedicated resource(s) along with the necessary functional and support staff such as a team leader and a project manager.</li>
	<li>The client will not attempt to engage in business with current or ex-staff on a personal basis. Contravention of this will lead to legal proceedings involving all parties. All EZ Rankings employees have confidentiality clauses in their employment contract and have signed non-disclosure agreements.</li>
	<li>The resource(s) would be operating out of the Indian office of EZ Rankings. The Indian office operates Monday - Friday, 09:30 AM to 06:30 PM (India's time zone is GMT + 5:30 / BST +4.30). All the public holidays are notified in advance and communicated by the development team directly; the holidays are generally compensated by working extra hours in the evenings, at weekends or as per the agreed time schedule with the client.</li>

When a developer(s) is working on a dedicated basis, they are allocated for 40 hours per week, 160 hours per month etc. This time includes design, programming, testing and time spent awaiting feedback requested by the developer(s) to the client.</li>
	<li>Both the parties undertake to disclose the information including "confidential information" only to a minimum number of its employees who need to have the information disclosed to them only on a "need-to-know" basis and to ensure that the obligations on use and disclosure of the information are observed by all of the said employees.</li>

EZ Rankings has the right to "define" the "type" of a project. Third party services might require additional time.</li>
	<li>During the course of the "project" it is the client's responsibility to provide all (but not limited to the following) the relevant information, content, pictures, previous code etc... in order to make the project technically feasible and viable - in the absence of the above or any other relevant material EZ Rankings will use freeware / shareware material as deemed fit.</li>
	<li>EZ Rankings will not be held responsible in case the client insists on using a particular "copyrighted" material - EZ Rankings would assume that the client has taken care of the legal and copyright implications of using the same and once the final payment and or the website has been made "live" it is deemed that the client has given the go ahead to use the above-mentioned material at its own risk and consequences.</li>
	<li>After the receipt of final payment, the client will own the specific instances of all code we produce for you but not the algorithms, techniques, methods, or trade secrets we use to produce it and which belong to EZ Rankings.</li>
	<li>If during the course of the work the client is unable to provide us with necessary information, materials or feedback in a timely manner when requested (within 24 hours) it could become necessary to reschedule the team / resource to other projects while we are waiting. Any delay in re-allocating resources off the project during these waiting periods will be taken from the allocated project time.</li>
	<li>If we request materials, information, decisions, or approvals from you that we need to complete the work, and you do not provide them within thirty days of our request, we will deem the work to be completed and all payments due.</li>
	<li>Existing sites – Work done on an existing site is done on an unseen basis: Due to the nature of existing sites (sites already finished or part finished by a third party) we cannot predict code integrity. We undertake this work on the understanding that we will research and develop the existing code, but we make no guarantees that the previous work is a suitable framework for us to work with.</li>
	<li>Live servers, all development work takes place "off-site" on a Sandbox environment provided by us. On occasion, it may be requested that development takes places on live servers (time constraints, upon client request, licensing reasons for example). This is done so at your own risk. We do not take responsibility for any impact this may have to either the live site or your ability to work. We strongly recommend the use of a Sandbox server.</li>
	<li>Payments for time worked are not refundable if the work is cancelled before completion.</li>

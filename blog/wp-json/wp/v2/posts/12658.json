Usually, a footer is the first place individuals go to when they are lost on a website. With a footer, it becomes easy for anyone to navigate a website. For instance, just by redesigning the website footer, a luxury handbag website increased sales conversion by 27 percent and improved its revenue by 16 percent as reported by Smart Insights.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence, optimizing the footer may not be such a bad idea after all. It might seem like a waste of time, but it\u2019s not, as a website footer can certainly increase conversions and engagement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, a well-optimized footer contains different information from that of a header. In this regard, the footer adds additional information and value for the users. The header should contain the most essential pages of a website whereas, the footer should work as a safety section allowing website visitors to navigate conveniently. Therefore, the footer contains more exclusive information and enhances the website experience and page value for the users.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, the footer can contain some CTA\u2019s, thus allowing, for conversions to boost. Most optimized footers contain CTA\u2019s which allow a website user to complete an action. Therefore, footers are more important than they are thought of, provided they are designed well.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Begin_With_Website_Footer_Optimization\"><\/span>How To Begin With Website Footer Optimization?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The space in the website footer should contain some crucial information to allow for conversions and engagement to happen.

At the end of the page, every business has an opportunity to associate the business with the brand logo. Hence, on the exit, a business can display its brand identity via logos and images. All optimized footers contain logos and brand imagery to leave a lasting impact on an individual\u2019s mind.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Terms_Of_Service_Privacy_Policy_And_Copyright_Notice\"><\/span>2.

More commonly, it\u2019s the footer that contains links to such information. Containing such information in the footer also adds to the credibility of a brand and any opportunity to build trust with your customers should not be ignored. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t take much time to add this information.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Quick_Support_Services\"><\/span>3. Quick Support Services<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For questions before or after a purchase, website visitors often use footers.

You can include details such as hours of operation, email, address, phone number, and other contact details.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Site_Navigation\"><\/span>5. Site Navigation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most crucial pieces of information a footer can contain is site navigation. The most common reason why website visitors go to a footer is that they can\u2019t find a specific page on the website. Moreover, a website visitor can learn more about a company\u2019s products and services with the footer of a page. For people who can\u2019t find what they\u2019re looking for on a website, a footer can navigate them to that very specific page.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Include_CTAs\"><\/span>6. Include CTA\u2019s<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A great way to enhance the value of a website is by adding CTA\u2019s. With effective CTA\u2019s, it&#8217;s easy to convert website visitors. Moreover, it&#8217;s a great way to enhance the value of a landing page. Adding a CTA most certainly has a positive impact on lead generation and visitor engagement. Individuals who&#8217;ve made it to the last can also easily convert if they find a CTA in the footer of the page.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Feature_Essential_Company_Info\"><\/span>7.

In other words, it can be said that these are hyperlinks of a particular domain. These links are very helpful to Search Engines or in this case Google to navigate your website on the internet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has been seen that in most of the cases, the homepage, posts and menu contain these internal links. Using them in content is no longer new and these kinds of internal links are called a contextual link. Believe it or not, the proper use of internal linking can make a huge difference to your Search Engine Optimization. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around 92% of the market experts are of the view that this internal linking SEO will dominate the ranking system of Google and other search engines in upcoming days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read &#8211;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/content-marketing-strategies\/\">Content Marketing Strategies<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_are_internal_links_important\"><\/span><b>Why are internal links important?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The efficient use of internal links gives Google access to track the content of your website daily. These links are a sure-fire way of passing the authority between pages. Internal links also enhance brand awareness boosting the rank of your website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides, these links help the users find more interesting and relevant content while checking out the site for a particular topic.

If you dig deeper you will see that around 43.7% of the high ranking pages in the search engine derive their traffic from proper utilization of reciprocal links.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_many_types_of_interlinks_are_there\"><\/span><b>How many types of interlinks are there?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are only two types of such links. The first one is the navigational link which helps the consumers land on their desired page in no time.

If you were alert while reading Wikipedia, you may have noticed blue and clickable links appearing in the middle of the text. A single click on them will direct you to another relevant page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is another special type of link called external links. They are also known as backlinks or inbound links. As the name suggests an external link is the link of someone else\u2019s website. If you are interested in numbers, you will be thrilled to know that only 2.2% of the posts receive a link from other websites and the process is quite expensive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is shifting the trend to internal linking more day by day.

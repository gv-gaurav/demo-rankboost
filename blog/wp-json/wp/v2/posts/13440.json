You must have seen in the footer of many websites saying &#8216;powered by (company name)&#8217; or &#8216;trusted by (company name)&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>These are generally affiliate links that help the company in some way. For example, if you buy a product from the company&#8217;s website using that link, the company will pay the affiliate a certain percentage of the sale amount. Affiliate marketing is a popular monetization technique for bloggers and social media influencers.<\/p>\n<p>The working of affiliate marketing can be explained with the help of an example. Let&#8217;s suppose company A is selling a product on its website and company B has a blog. Company B writes a blog post about company A&#8217;s product and includes an affiliate link to the product on its website.<\/p>\n<p>Now, whenever a user clicks on that link and buys the product from company A&#8217;s website, company A will pay Company B a certain commission. The commission varies from product to product and company to company. It is generally a small percentage of the sale amount but can be higher for expensive products.<\/p>\n<p>Affiliate marketing is a great way to make money online. You can be an affiliate for companies of your choice and promote their products on your blog, social media, or website. And, whenever a sale is made through your affiliate link, you earn a commission.<\/p>\n<p>It is a simple process and doesn&#8217;t require any investment. You can start affiliate marketing with just a blog or social media account.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Parties_involved_in_affiliate_marketing\"><\/span>Parties involved in affiliate marketing:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13441\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/10114819\/Become-an-Affiliate-Marketer.jpg\" alt=\"Become-an-Affiliate-Marketer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/10114819\/Become-an-Affiliate-Marketer.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/10114819\/Become-an-Affiliate-Marketer-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/10114819\/Become-an-Affiliate-Marketer-768x403.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now that we know what affiliate marketing is, let&#8217;s understand the different parties involved in the process.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_The_Merchant\"><\/span>1.

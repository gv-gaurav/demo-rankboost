You effectively gather prospect information from a variety of desktop or mobile ads. When a person clicks on the target ad, they see a pop-up window appear with pre-filled in data. Most of the time, it simply requires that the user confirms the data and you automatically acquire a new lead. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Facebook Lead Ads to collect information at any point through your sales funnel. You can use it to create sign-ups for your newsletter. This works well with both your existing customers and also potential clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you prefer, you can offer coupons and deals, but the majority of automotive marketers find that sharing information on the vehicles is successful.

You will have a carousel, video or single image option. Most of the time, it makes the most sense to go with a video or a single image.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you use a high-quality image that will capture attention. You will also need to create catchy text and don\u2019t forget to include a CTA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t neglect the lead form. This might be one of the most critical steps of the entire design process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Best_Practices\"><\/span><b>Best Practices<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you create a lookalike audience, make sure you use real customers. If you create this list from prospects, you will only end up with more leads that are less qualified. What you want to do is build a profile of the ideal customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you create the form, use the least amount of fields as possible. If you make the form too complicated, people aren\u2019t going to fill it out. Just make sure that you gather the information that you truly need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Display your ads at the right time. Try to schedule the ads when your audience is active.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the offers clear. Any offer that you promote needs to be made clear. You want your audience to know what they will receive for signing up.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, don\u2019t forget to test your campaign. After all, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to pour a bunch of money into something you haven\u2019t proven yet. While Facebook Lead Ads are a strong way to generate more leads for your business, there are times when something just won\u2019t work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like <a href=\"https:\/\/thesocialshepherd.com\/blog\/top-facebook-ads-agency-uk\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Ads<\/a>, there are times when you won\u2019t see the fruit of your labor, but by following our steps you set yourself on the path of success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Author&#8217;s Bio:<\/strong> Harry is an experienced writer working for <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimlogic.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.aimlogic.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the last 4 years.

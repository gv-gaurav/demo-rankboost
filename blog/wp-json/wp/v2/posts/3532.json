Using the right amount of keywords in content connects your website to various search engines and improves visibility. Before creating your website\u2019s content, it is important to dig into detailed keyword research. Optimizing content for global and generic keywords will only bring in visitors who are not interested in buying your product. Therefore, your website content must include specific, services\/products and relevant keywords to attract quality traffic and improve ranking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you are done with deep keyword research, make sure to use them in the right quantity. Using too many or too few keywords in content is another mistake that leads to poor SEO results. Include keywords to optimize URL, headings, titles, and descriptions. Using well-optimized content will fetch you more valuable opportunities and boost the website\u2019s traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Not_having_an_effective_plan_and_realistic_goal\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#2. <\/span><b>Not having an effective plan and realistic goal<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To survive in this world full of competitors, it is crucial to have an effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-packages.html\">SEO plan<\/a> and set goals.

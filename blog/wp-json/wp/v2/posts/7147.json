It is very easy to do so, and you can not only identify the country where you want your ads to be seen, but also the region, state or province to make your campaign more focused. You can even choose latitude-longitude coordinates to confine your campaign to a specific area.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3\"><\/span><strong>Step 3<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you need to fix a budget that you would like to set aside for this campaign.

It can be added later after the completion of the entire setup process. After saving these changes, move ahead to the next step.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_5\"><\/span><strong>Step 5<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you are done with the above steps, start writing your first ad. Ensure that your ad has a keyword that helps potential clients clock on the ad. The headline must have an optimized keyword. The headline must not be more than 25 characters, so you have to be really creative when giving a headline to the ad. The second and third line must not have more than 35 characters with the last line must have your display URL<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_6\"><\/span><strong>Step 6<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you need to insert keywords into your account\u2019s keyword field. The keywords can be pasted and add signs like [], + and \u201c \u201c and see the number of searches you get for these different signs. To begin with, it is better to use fewer keywords. Once you start getting good results, more keyword can be added.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_7\"><\/span><strong>Step 7<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Set your default bid or maximum price per click. While doing so, it is important to understand that every keyword has a different market. Thus, every keyword has to have a different bid price. To begin with, you can bid on keywords that are lower-priced and later start bidding on the higher-priced keyword.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_8\"><\/span><strong>Step 8<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After completing all the above-mentioned steps, it is important to check the ad carefully. The keywords must match with the ad perfectly so that best results are obtained. Check the position on the page you are looking for, and after reviewing everything, you can go ahead with the ad.

As far as handling a business is concerned, all you need is a customer and you may get a series of reviews which seems to be the starting point for a debate but there are things that you may not like about every review. It may not be possible to delete one review because it is negative and does not spread good words about your business rather you need to eliminate the entire page. However, you may lose certain features as well along with the page of review but it will not make a lot of difference if you are not a retailer in the real sense. While you can remove the page, for now, it is possible to bring it back later if you need it.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_69 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title \" >Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" aria-label=\"Toggle Table of Content\"><span class=\"ez-toc-js-icon-con\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"eztoc-hide\" style=\"display:none;\">Toggle<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-icon-toggle-span\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"\/blog\/how-to-remove-reviews-from-facebook\/#Taking_the_first_step\" title=\"Taking the first step\">Taking the first step<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"\/blog\/how-to-remove-reviews-from-facebook\/#Managing_the_reviews\" title=\"Managing the reviews\">Managing the reviews<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"\/blog\/how-to-remove-reviews-from-facebook\/#Putting_the_comment\" title=\"Putting the comment\">Putting the comment<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"\/blog\/how-to-remove-reviews-from-facebook\/#Reviews_from_local_customers\" title=\"Reviews from local customers\">Reviews from local customers<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"\/blog\/how-to-remove-reviews-from-facebook\/#Skimming_the_reviews\" title=\"Skimming the reviews\">Skimming the reviews<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"\/blog\/how-to-remove-reviews-from-facebook\/#Going_through_the_reviews\" title=\"Going through the reviews\">Going through the reviews<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Taking_the_first_step\"><\/span><strong>Taking the first step<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All that you need to do is to log in to the business ID and then visit the settings.

If you are wondering whether it is possible to remove one review that speaks against your products or services but Facebook may do away with the reviews which are not related to your service. However, reviews cannot be removed at your will rather you need to close the review page completely.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Managing_the_reviews\"><\/span><strong>Managing the reviews<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To ensure that the reviews present in <a href=\"\/blog\/seo-cheat-for-facebook\/\"><strong>Facebook<\/strong><\/a> are beneficial for the business you need to manage it in an appropriate manner. For instance, you need to ask people for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/online-reputation-management-services.html\">positive reviews<\/a> and there is no harm in talking about this to the clients to write or share the positive experience in the form of reviews.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Putting_the_comment\"><\/span><strong>Putting the comment<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Have you ever bothered to study the pattern of review on Facebook? You have to think several times before putting the comment back as the consequences can have a negative effect on your business. In addition to this, the comments need to take the right path and whenever you get good reviews you need to thank the supporters and provide clarifications for the questions. If you are in the midst of the conversation about the review you cannot exit the page suddenly unless the other party is ready to leave.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reviews_from_local_customers\"><\/span><strong>Reviews from local customers<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you wonder how you can improve the reviews that are posted about your business, it is good to look for reviews that come from the local customers. You can improve the ranking of the website drastically with the help that comes locally from the customers and earn a good reputation.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Skimming_the_reviews\"><\/span><strong>Skimming the reviews<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You might as well skim the reviews carefully to find out what is good or bad for the business and although Facebook may not allow you remove the individual reviews you can try to respond to them at the right time and use appropriate words to make the cut. Words for that matter can change a lot of things and a single review cannot create a devastating effect unless it is extremely negative. However, if you cannot do anything about the review, it is good enough to ignore it and certainly, customers will not depend on one review to counter the claims you have made about the business.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Going_through_the_reviews\"><\/span><strong>Going through the reviews<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What you need to do is to go through the reviews carefully and if there is a violation of the terms Facebook will take a step ahead and remove it.

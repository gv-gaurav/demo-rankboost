A patent gives the inventor of an app, product, process, or other creation the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, importing, and distributing their invention without permission for a set period of time. This means that any person who wants to use your patented idea must seek permission from you first before they can do so legally. Patents are granted by national governments and provide protection for both small and large businesses alike.<\/p>\n<p>Having a patent helps protect your idea or product from being stolen by competitors, and it also helps you to reap the rewards of your hard work. It gives you a legal right to take action against anyone who attempts to duplicate your invention without permission.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_is_a_Patent_Important_for_Your_App\"><\/span>Why is a Patent Important for Your App?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13886\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20125102\/Why-is-a-Patent-Important-for-Your-App.jpg\" alt=\"Why is a Patent Important for Your App\" width=\"980\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20125102\/Why-is-a-Patent-Important-for-Your-App.jpg 980w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20125102\/Why-is-a-Patent-Important-for-Your-App-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20125102\/Why-is-a-Patent-Important-for-Your-App-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A patent is an important legal document for any inventor or entrepreneur who wants to protect their idea.

Let&#8217;s understand them in detail:<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Provisional_Patenting\"><\/span>1. Provisional Patenting:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Provisional patenting is a way to protect your app idea. It means filing papers and paying fees so that no one else can use, market, import, or distribute your idea without your permission. It also means looking up information to make sure someone else has not already patented the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>The provisional patent lasts for one year and allows you to market your idea as &#8220;patent pending.&#8221; This type of patent is ideal for small businesses or individuals that may not have the resources to immediately pursue a non-provisional patent.<\/p>\n<p>The best part about the provisional patent is that it allows you to test the market and make changes to your app idea before filing a non-provisional patent. You do not need any kind of legal compliance or assistance to file a provisional patent.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done the research and determined that your idea is unique and there are no competitors, you can move forward with the provisional patent.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Non-provisional_Patent\"><\/span>2. Non-provisional Patent:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Non-provisional patenting is the more common and preferred way to protect your mobile app idea. This type of patent gives you exclusive rights to your invention, allowing you to prevent others from using, selling, importing, and distributing it without permission.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike a provisional patent, a non-provisional patent lasts for 20 years from the filing date. It also requires legal compliance and assistance to file.<\/p>\n<p>The non-provisional patent process typically takes longer than the provisional patent because it involves extensive research, filing documents, and fees, and has several other requirements that must be met before the patent is granted.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that it&#8217;s possible for someone else to have the same idea as you. In this case, the first one to file for a patent will have exclusive rights over that invention. The non-provisional patent is ideal for large businesses and\/or products that have the potential to generate revenue.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_Patent_is_Right_for_Your_Business_App\"><\/span>Which Patent is Right for Your Business App?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13889\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20132110\/Right-Patent-for-Your-Business-App.jpg\" alt=\"Right Patent for Your Business App\" width=\"900\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20132110\/Right-Patent-for-Your-Business-App.jpg 900w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20132110\/Right-Patent-for-Your-Business-App-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/20132110\/Right-Patent-for-Your-Business-App-768x404.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whether you should pursue a provisional or non-provisional patent for your mobile app idea depends on several factors.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have limited resources and the potential for revenue is uncertain, then a provisional patent is your best option. It allows you to test the market and make changes before committing to the more expensive non-provisional patent.<\/li>\n<li>If you have the resources to pursue a non-provisional patent and\/or your app has revenue potential, then that option is likely the better choice. It offers more protection and exclusivity than a provisional patent, giving you peace of mind that your invention won&#8217;t be stolen or copied without permission.<\/li>\n<li>Once you decide which type of patent you want to pursue, the next step is to start researching. Make sure your idea is unique and that no one has already patented something similar.<\/li>\n<li>Once you have confirmed that your invention is unique, it&#8217;s time to apply for a patent. This process involves filing documents and paying fees, so make sure you are well-prepared before submitting your application.<\/li>\n<li>Patenting a mobile app idea is a long and complex process that requires research and commitment.

Search and enlist with a legal patent attorney:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The first step in patenting an app idea is to search for and enlist a legal patent attorney. Patent attorneys have experience in filing patents, so they will be able to provide you with the right advice and guidance throughout the process. The legal professional will help you draft and submit the patent application, as well as review any legal issues that may arise during the process.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t rush in hiring the attorney, do your research and hire the one with a good reputation and experience in the field, as it may save you time and money in the long run. Once you have hired your attorney, the next step is to file for a provisional or non-provisional patent.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_Mobile_app_invention_showcase\"><\/span>Step 2. Mobile app invention showcase:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Just having an app idea is half the battle; you also need to showcase it in the right way. Include images, diagrams, and other visuals that demonstrate how your app works. This will help make your invention more understandable for patent offices as well as potential customers or investors.<\/p>\n<p>The patent court needs to see that your invention is unique and that no one has already patented a similar idea. Being able to clearly illustrate your idea will help prove this point. Once the court is satisfied that your invention meets all the criteria, you will be granted the patent.<\/p>\n<p>To improve the odds of getting the patient, consider creating a prototype that can be demonstrated in the patent office. This will give you a concrete example of how your invention works, as opposed to just a set of drawings and diagrams.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_Do_in-depth_practice_of_patent_search\"><\/span>Step 3. Do in-depth practice of patent search:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Websites like USPTO.gov and Google Patents allow you to perform patent searches. Use them to ensure that no one has already patented your mobile app idea before you file for a patent. If you find that someone has already patented something similar to yours, then it&#8217;s probably best not to proceed with the application.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to patent searches, you should also conduct a thorough search of the App Store and Google Play. If your app idea is already available, then it&#8217;s most likely not patentable.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of the patent search is to ensure that no one has already patented your invention before you file your application. If you do find a similar invention, then it&#8217;s best to move on and come up with another idea.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_Go_for_provisional_or_non-provisional_patent\"><\/span>Step 4. Go for provisional or non-provisional patent:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Once you have done your research and determined that your invention is unique, then it&#8217;s time to file the patent application. Depending on the type of invention, you can either apply for a provisional or non-provisional patent.<\/p>\n<p>A provisional patent gives you one year to refine your invention before you have to file for a full patent. This is a good option if you need more time to develop your invention and make sure it&#8217;s market-ready before applying for the full patent.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re confident that your invention is ready for filing, then a non-provisional patent may be the better option. This type of patent will give you full protection for your invention and make it easier to take legal action against anyone who tries to steal or copy your invention.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have filed the application, you will need to wait several months before you receive a response from the patent office.

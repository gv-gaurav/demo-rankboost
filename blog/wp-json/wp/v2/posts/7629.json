However, with the Venice update, the traditional results with \u201c10 blue link\u201d began catering to local intent. The local intent is clearly defined as queries that have got to do with X in this town or X is near him but some of the queries can have intent local even though they are not clear. During the times&#8217; bygone users were capable of making queries without search intent that is dominant but were common multiple. On this Google always returned an optimization that was SERP based. However, with Venice search engines include results of the search based on set physical location or the IP address.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Opening_Doors\"><\/span><strong>Opening Doors <\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The update of Venice has also opened lot many doors to smaller brands and enterprises thus giving opportunities to them to rank for shirt tailed phrases of search and bigger marquee.

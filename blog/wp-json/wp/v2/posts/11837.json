References and reviews<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both references and reviews matter when picking up the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\">SEO company in India<\/a>. You can visit their website and other independent review websites to know what customers have to say about them. The SEO company should have positive reviews as it ensures they are experienced and trustworthy. Check their Google My Business reviews and references on business listing websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the company has more than 70% of positive reviews, you can consider that firm. It is the simplest way to shortlist professional SEO companies. If the company has a Facebook page, you can also check out their customer reviews on the page as you will get several reviews there. You can shortlist four to five companies based on customer reviews and ratings. And, if you find contact details of their customers who have used their services, you can call them to ask for their review.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Portfolio_and_case_studies\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.

Only when you are convinced with their work, you can go ahead. If you are looking for additional services like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/ppc-services-india.html\">PPC services<\/a>, you can ask for those particular case studies too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Check_out_their_blogs\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.

It is because content marketing is among the most important marketing aspects that the online SEO company should do with excellence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out at least four to five blogs of the company to know how in-depth they can go while preparing content for your company.

Read their contracts carefully<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most companies ask you to sign a contract for their services in which you need to pay them their charges for a couple of months which is majority three or six months. On the other hand, there are some companies that offer monthly packages that require no contract. While signing the contract go through their fee structure to check if there are any hidden fees or additional service charges. It&#8217;s very important to read the complete contract to be very sure about the company that you are going to hire.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These were some of the most powerful and easy-to-implement tips that will help you pick the right online SEO Firm for your business growth.

When someone types a search query related to your industry, your business should appear in the search results(preferably at the top). Paid and unpaid(organic) forms of marketing can help you achieve these rankings. As a result, Search Marketing has two disciplines:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>SEO or Search Engine Optimization(Unpaid Marketing)<\/li>\n<li>SEM or Search Engine Marketing(Paid Marketing)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SEO\"><\/span>SEO<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simply put, Search Engine Optimization consists of those internet marketing or digital marketing tactics that are organic or unpaid. SEO allows a business to market itself organically on the internet. This can involve tactics such as content generation and dissemination, Off-Page SEO, Technical SEO, Local SEO, and more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the organic and paid ranks displayed on a Google SERP(Search Engine Result Page) are different. Paid rankings have the word &#8220;Paid&#8221; in front of them and appear at the top. On the contrary, organic results appear just below paid ads.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12500\" style=\"width: 604px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12500\" class=\"wp-image-12500 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060359\/A-Google-Search-Page-Differently-Displaying-Paid-And-Organic-Results.jpg\" alt=\"A Google Search Page Differently Displaying Paid And Organic Results\" width=\"594\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060359\/A-Google-Search-Page-Differently-Displaying-Paid-And-Organic-Results.jpg 594w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060359\/A-Google-Search-Page-Differently-Displaying-Paid-And-Organic-Results-300x271.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-12500\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eebew.com\/seo-tutorial\/paid-search-vs-organic-search\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>: A Google Search Page Differently Displaying Paid And Organic Results<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main reason why companies use this sort of search marketing is that SEO is both productive and cost-efficient. It helps a brand build trust and authority with its audience. With higher rankings on the SERP, the website traffic automatically increases leading to more organic visitors and higher sales and revenue. Also to note, as per a study carried out by GroupM UK and Nielsen, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2012\/08\/23\/organic-vs-paid-search-results-organic-wins-94-of-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">94% of the clicks<\/a> go to organic search results. This further demonstrates that people trust organic results more, which is why SEO is crucial for organizations.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SEM\"><\/span>SEM<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Businesses use paid advertising to promote their websites on search engines through Search Engine Marketing. There&#8217;s a process for it as well, which you&#8217;ll learn about later in this blog. But for now, you should know that paid results appear at the top of the SERP.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12501\" style=\"width: 737px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12501\" class=\"wp-image-12501 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060555\/A-Google-SERP-Displaying-Paid-Results.jpg\" alt=\"A Google SERP Displaying Paid Results\" width=\"727\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060555\/A-Google-SERP-Displaying-Paid-Results.jpg 727w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060555\/A-Google-SERP-Displaying-Paid-Results-300x216.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-12501\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.acquisio.com\/blog\/agency\/difference-between-organic-paid-search\/\" target=\"_blank\">Source<\/a>: A Google SERP Displaying Paid Results<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Digital Marketing is a competitive space and organic efforts may not always yield the intended results. It is then that businesses need to put some budget behind their digital marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SEM is a conveniently customizable process and can work wonders if the organic digital marketing strategy or SEO isn&#8217;t producing results. Through Search Engine Marketing, a business can see quick growth or results. As per Google Economic Impact Report, a business makes an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/economicimpact.google.com\/methodology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$2 in revenue for every $1 spent<\/a> on Google Ads. Therefore, SEM or paid Google Ads may quickly propel your internet marketing efforts to new heights and is thus an essential component of Search Marketing.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Does_SEM_Work\"><\/span>How Does SEM Work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The major goal of this blog is to focus on SEM and how it can help a business. Therefore, to start with, you should know that SEM is different from SEO. Keep in mind that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services-india.html\">SEO services<\/a> might take anything from three months to a year to produce results or to achieve the target rankings. On the contrary, SEM can get you the ranks more quickly, if done wisely. Because you&#8217;ll be paying money on this form of promotion or marketing, you need to be cautious. So, to get it right there are a few things you should know starting with:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Ad_Auction\"><\/span>The Ad Auction<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once your business is ready to invest in SEM or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/paid-advertising-predictions\/\">paid marketing<\/a>, you enter an ad auction in Google Ads. You make ads to spread your message, to advertise your products or services, etc. These ads are then shown on the SERP. Every business participates in an ad auction before the results are shown on the SERP. The ad auction has a bidding system. You place bids on the keywords or search terms that are relevant to your industry. As a result, you must first conduct deep, comprehensive keyword research to get the keywords sorted for the ad auction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s unwise to bid on every keyword as you&#8217;ll be paying for them. It&#8217;s preferable to target keywords with a high search volume and low competition. As a result, select particular keywords that you are confident will generate leads and income.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mind you, not every search query or keyword displays ads. But the ones that do display ads and if you&#8217;re optimizing for it, then it can become highly profitable for you on those keywords.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Keywords_In_Google_Ads\"><\/span>The Keywords In Google Ads<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once, you&#8217;ve chosen your ideal keywords related to your niche, it&#8217;s time you optimize them. To do so, there are ways and more majorly, the types of keywords that you can use in Google Ads:<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Broad Match Keywords:<\/strong> Broad Match Keywords appear when the user&#8217;s search query or term is related to or close to the keyword you&#8217;ve chosen. This means if your chosen keyword is sports shoes and you go for the broad match keyword setting, then your ad may also appear for searches such as running sports shoes, fitting sports shoes, and more. Take a look at this example:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_12502\" style=\"width: 443px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12502\" class=\"wp-image-12502 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060838\/Broad-Match-Keyword.jpg\" alt=\"Broad Match Keyword\" width=\"433\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060838\/Broad-Match-Keyword.jpg 433w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03060838\/Broad-Match-Keyword-300x177.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-12502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7478529?hl=en#zippy=%2Cbroad-match\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>: A Broad Match Keyword And The Searches That It Could Appear For<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, broad match keywords appear for broad or related topics rather than specialized or rigid searches. To make your ad more visible for related searches, going for Broad Match Keywords is the best option. There&#8217;s no syntax for broad match keywords and simply entering them in Google Ads makes them broad match. So, therefore, by default, keywords are the broad match.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Phrase Match Keywords:<\/strong> A phrase match keyword setting allows your ad to appear if your selected keyword has the same meaning as the search query. Therefore, your ads appear less frequently than the Broad Match keywords. The syntax is to put &#8221; &#8221; around the keyword, i.e. &#8220;[Your Keyword]&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div id=\"attachment_12503\" style=\"width: 703px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12503\" class=\"wp-image-12503 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03061049\/Phrase-Match-Keyword.jpg\" alt=\"Phrase Match Keyword\" width=\"693\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03061049\/Phrase-Match-Keyword.jpg 693w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03061049\/Phrase-Match-Keyword-300x109.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-12503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/7478529?hl=en#zippy=%2Cbroad-match%2Cphrase-match\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source<\/a>: An Example Of A Phrase Match Keyword<\/p><\/div>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Exact Match Keywords:<\/strong> As the name implies, Exact Match Keywords only appear for searches that have the exact same meaning and intent.

To do this, simply add a minus (-) symbol before the keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can optimize your ad keywords as you like, but it&#8217;s critical to remember your budget and target demographic. It&#8217;s important to narrow your chosen keywords for the searches which is why Google Ads allows you to do so.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Keyword_Cost\"><\/span>Keyword Cost<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Google Ads assigns a quality score to every ad. The ads with the higher bid have a competitive advantage in getting a good quality score. Your maximum bid and the quality of your copy or ad are used to determine the quality score of your ad. As a result, because bid or keyword cost is a component of quality score, they are incredibly important.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, be cautious when deciding keyword cost as it affects your ad quality score. The better the quality score of your ad, the higher it gets placed on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You should be aware that keywords with a high level of competition normally have a higher price or are more expensive. The budget should be set based on the keyword&#8217;s competition. Going too low on your bid can decrease the chances of your ad showing up. In the USA<a href=\"https:\/\/www.verizon.com\/business\/small-business-essentials\/resources\/how-much-does-google-adwords-cost-its-a\/#:~:text=In%20the%20US%2C%20if%20you,the%20average%20is%20under%20%241.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">, the average cost per click<\/a> is between $1 and$2 on the search network. As a result, your bid price must be balanced. You can also fine-tune your keywords as Broad Match, Phrase Match, or Exact Match as discussed above. Doing this allows you to target your ads for a specific audience.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Ad_Copy\"><\/span>The Ad Copy<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Writing good ads is crucial and impacts your quality score significantly. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s your ad copy that makes an impact and makes a search engine user click on it. The ad consists of the following components:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Title<\/li>\n<li>URL<\/li>\n<li>Description<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First and foremost, create an appealing advertisement that responds to a user query. After all, Search Engines are all about answering a user query. So have a relevant title, URL, and description that aptly describes what the users are searching for. Also, make the ad&#8217;s landing page as relevant as possible. The landing page is the page user lands on after clicking on your ad. All these factors combined with the ad budget determine the quality score and that affects your paid rankings on the SERP.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, keep in mind you don&#8217;t pay your maximum bid.

Structuring your ad campaigns allows you to wisely spend your money or budget. Most certainly, no company has one keyword to target and they have a group of keywords that they&#8217;d like to target through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/search-engine-marketing-services.html\">SEM<\/a>. As a result, planning and organizing your campaigns become crucial.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Combining all your ad keywords in a single ad would allow only high-volume keywords to show as the entire budget would get spent on them. That&#8217;s not a wise thing to happen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, it&#8217;s preferable to arrange your ads on several levels. To do so, keep these definitions in mind:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Campaign: This is the highest level for managing several ad groups.<\/li>\n<li>Ad Group: A group of keywords grouped by theme.<\/li>\n<li>Keywords and Ad: The copy that gets displayed on the search engine with your target keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keeping this structure in mind will allow you to build better ad campaigns, the ones that are better organized. Also, remember to make use of ad extensions. Ad extensions allow you to include additional information in your ad. It could be a phone number, any links, etc. Adding a single new ad extension boosts the CTR or Click Through Rate <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6167131?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">by 10-15%<\/a>, as per Google data. In your advertising, you can include one or more extensions.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12506\" style=\"width: 654px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12506\" class=\"wp-image-12506 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03061644\/A-Google-Ad-Consisting-Of-Call-Extension.jpg\" alt=\"Source: A Google Ad Consisting Of Call Extension\" width=\"644\" height=\"144\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03061644\/A-Google-Ad-Consisting-Of-Call-Extension.jpg 644w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/03061644\/A-Google-Ad-Consisting-Of-Call-Extension-300x67.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-12506\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2011\/09\/15\/adwords-ad-extensions-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Source<\/a>: A Google Ad Consisting Of Call Extension<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, remain flexible with your ads and continue to test what works and what doesn&#8217;t.

It&#8217;s a potent strategy to bring your target customers back to your website and get them to place an order. With Retargeting, your brand products and services stay in the mind of a past visitor. If they click on your ad, you can then redirect them to your website. Not just from buying perspective but even if you want to achieve a conversion like filling a form, downloading a PDF, you can redirect customers for all such purposes with Retargeting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ad Remarketing, on the other hand, is to push products or services to those customers that have already done business with you. Ad Remarketing primarily makes use of Email to connect with your customers. In fact, as per Moz, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/the-power-of-email-remarketing\" target=\"_blank\">the conversion rate from remarketing emails can be as high as 41%.<\/a> It&#8217;s a good customer retention tactic. Remarketing could include offering similar products or services, giving your customers a discount on your products or services, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, there&#8217;s no denying that remarketing and retargeting can significantly improve the performance of your SEM campaign. Both of these strategies have various applications, and if you utilize them in the right way, you&#8217;ll get results.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SEO and SEM are the two components that make up SEM.

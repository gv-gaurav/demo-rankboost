According to industry experts, over 60% of businesses don&#8217;t want to try a business with negative reviews. Therefore, your online reputation can bring or drive customers away from your business. 2024 brings new prospects in maintaining your online reputation and you must act in the following ways:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Determine_Your_Current_Status\"><\/span><b>1. Determine Your Current Status\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, see where you stand. You&#8217;ve made a profile on Google My Business(GMB) and other websites. Now, determine what&#8217;s your current status on them. Knowing what your current reputation is can give you a healthy start.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your ratings are bad, then you have a lot of work to do. On the other hand, if your ratings are good, then you can look for ways to optimize and maintain those ratings. Providing exceptional services to your customers, or clients, or anyone associated with you is important. There&#8217;s no better marketing than how you provide your services to your customers or clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, knowing where to start, is a good place to begin and then proceed further.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read &#8211;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/online-reputation-management-tutorial-for-a-newbie\/\">Online Reputation Management Tutorial for a Newbie<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/vital-tools-for-online-reputation-management\/\">5 Vital Tools for Online Reputation Management<\/a><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Observe_And_Respond_To_Your_Reviews_Or_Mentions\"><\/span><b>2. \u00a0 Observe And Respond To Your Reviews Or Mentions\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must watch and react to your mentions or reviews. Certainly, not everything will go your way. Remember that reacting to reviews\/ ratings, mentions, or a question is a form of customer service. Reacting to these can largely boost your online reputation and this factor isn&#8217;t going away in 2024.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large number of online complaints are lodged via social media so you must optimize your support team to better use social media to answer any queries or complaints. Reacting to reviews can develop a healthy relationship between the reviewer and the company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, it&#8217;s an art to handle negative reception and you should be extremely careful while handling these. Some measures you should follow while dealing with negative reception are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be professional in your reviews. People want to be heard. Be polite and don&#8217;t take the negative reception personally. Don&#8217;t blame or make excuses. Rather admit and handle the situation with grace and professionalism. If things escalate, make sure to handle the conversation privately. Give them your email or phone number and drive it away from the public eye.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always time your responses. Responding timely and accurately to your reviews or ratings can be a major player in your online reputation management strategy. You should react to all types of reviews, including negative reviews. Reacting to negative reviews can change the reviewer&#8217;s perception of your brand. Making it a two-way healthy conversation is the takeaway from this point as it also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/local-seo-services.html\">boosts your Local SEO<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of a social crisis or when things have escalated with the public or a client, it&#8217;s much better to come up with the right response as quickly as possible. Prevention is better than cure in this case as well. But if things have escalated, act smart and act quick. Stop all your current campaigns and manage the angry mob or client first.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Capitalize_On_Your_Positive_Reception\"><\/span><b>3.

However, optimizing for ORM requires more than just responding. Taking advantage of your positive online presence can further optimize your online reputation. Here are some of the tactics you can undertake:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use your positive reviews and testimonials as an example. You can ask clients, customers, or even your employees to share their positive feedback. Tell them to share their experience with the world. It will also encourage other clients or customers to share their feedback about your company as well. A video or a simple 4-line text can best serve this purpose. Highlighting the positive reviews can overpower the negative reception. This can boost your Local SEO rankings significantly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to use tools like BrightLocal or certain tools by Hootsuite. These tools can help you measure sentiment, monitor performance, request reviews, gain more web listing, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use social media to your advantage. You have a positive reception, spread the word through your social media business profiles. Tell your employees to share it as well.

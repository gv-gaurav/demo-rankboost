However, no one goes through all the results. In fact, more than 90% of individuals don&#8217;t get past page 1 of Google, as per Chitika Insights. They&#8217;ll more likely change their search terms. You can now see the importance of ranking on page 1 of Google. In this context, you can understand what relevance and authority can a featured snippet bring to your website described in the picture below:<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12343\" style=\"width: 862px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12343\" class=\"wp-image-12343 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/29113953\/Google-Featured-Snippets.png\" alt=\"A Featured Snippet\u00a0\" width=\"852\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/29113953\/Google-Featured-Snippets.png 852w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/29113953\/Google-Featured-Snippets-300x138.png 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/29113953\/Google-Featured-Snippets-768x352.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-12343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Featured Snippet<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranking at the top is something everyone wishes. This spot is known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/websearch\/answer\/9351707?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">featured snippet which is provided by Google<\/a> as a way to answer search queries clearly and concisely. Being at the top certainly can bring a lot of clicks which therefore translates to more traffic for a query. The featured snippet appears inside the box on the top of a Google result page.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under this special feature, Google automatically pulls relevant data from an indexed web page to showcase it to the visitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Google_Featured_Snippets_That_You_Can_See_On_Page_1_Of_Google\"><\/span><b>Google Featured Snippets That You Can See On Page 1 Of Google\u00a0\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The job of this featured snippet is to answer a specific query in a more clear, and concise way. There are a host of featured snippets that Google can display for a search query. Coming to the types of featured snippets, there are mainly four types of snippets that serve the same purpose but in different ways. Check out the different types of snippets:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paragraph Type<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">List Type<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Table Type<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video Type<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Paragraph_Type\"><\/span><b>Paragraph Type\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A paragraph type of snippet is the most common one. Approximately 70% of featured snippets are in the form of a paragraph. In this, Google pulls a whole paragraph from a website that fulfills the visitor\u2019s search query. For example \u2014 If you search for \u2018Number of restaurants in Australia\u2019, you will find a quick paragraph taken from a website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, paragraph type snippets are on an average of 42 words and 250 characters.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"List_Type\"><\/span><b>List Type<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, comes the list type of snippet, in which Google tries to solve the visitor\u2019s query by showing some sort of data that is either in the form of an ordered list or an unordered list shown in bullets. These types of snippets are generally ranked to those websites that have articles in listicle format and provide quick data, as usual, in the case of a featured snippet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Table_Type\"><\/span><b>Table Type<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The table form is used to showcase a collection of data simplistically. For example, if a user is searching for a series of data in his query, the chances are that Google will fetch data from a website that has it\u00a0 organized following a proper schema markup. The table on average consists of 45 words spanning five rows and two columns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Video_Type\"><\/span><b>Video Type<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we are moving towards digitization, video snippets are the hottest in the trends. If Google finds a relevant video to the search query, the whole YouTube video appears on the spot. On average, however, roughly, the videos are 7 minutes in length. Still, video type amounts for the lowest in the Google featured snippets with less than 5 percent of searches showing video snippets. But with videos in high demand, it seems like this number will change quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Benefits_Of_The_Featured_Snippets\"><\/span><b>The Benefits Of The Featured Snippets<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google featured snippets bring you a ton of\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/seo-importance-for-every-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO benefits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0for your website.

While writing content, if you can add some numbers, percentages, or ratios; the chances are high that Google will fetch a paragraph from your website for a search query.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand how the entire Google featured snippet works. You will notice that search engines are always trying to map a visitors\u2019 question with a relevant answer. If you have written a paragraph with a subheading for example, \u201cwhat are the main parts of a watch?\u201d, Google will fetch that paragraph to give users relevant data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the first important thing is always to focus on solving the user\u2019s problem to get highlighted in the search results. Using subheadings in question format always helps in gaining a featured snippet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, writing crisp answers in paragraphs, tables, lists, or making a video answering a user query can help you get your content on the featured snippet.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Learn_From_Your_Competitors_Featured_Snippet_Strategy\"><\/span><b>2.

Optimize For Vital SEO Tactics\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some strong SEO tactics work for Google Featured Snippet as well.

Have a good title and heading tags and write a descriptive meta description to help Google understand your page better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Have_A_Strong_Web_Presence\"><\/span><b>5.

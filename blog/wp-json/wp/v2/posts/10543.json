Industry:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some industries are very niche (Local \/ region-specific) that have only a handful of competition while others are highly competitive. Higher Competitive Industries surely need more work because they have more &amp; active competitors who are constantly working towards getting better results. So, opting for a basic plan will not make any difference. I will personally suggest if your business is in a highly competitive niche, you should pause, save &amp; possibly invest in a better plan. This promises you positive movements &amp; exposure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a premium package from an experienced digital marketing agency can help tough competition niches. As industries with high competition require more professional services, it&#8217;s better to go for an SEO package that includes quality content writing services, technical SEO, link building, and more. You should also look for advanced services like voice search optimization to overtake your competitors if your business is in a competitive niche.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Time\"><\/span>2. Time:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t we all want the best results in the minimum time frame? Without a doubt, the answer is Yes! But do you know only a few are successful in achieving their dream results within the defined time frame &amp; That\u2019s because although we all want the best result in the minimum time frame, not all want to opt for the suitable plan. Most of us want to opt for the basic plan &amp; dream of top-page results by the end of Month 1.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honestly speaking, you are simply wasting your money. My advice will be to give it time. After all, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. According to marketing experts, SEO efforts can take anywhere between 3-12 months. It all depends on the keyword you are targeting and your industry. It can also take a month or two if your competition is low. Any expert SEO agency can help you figure out the time duration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do want quick results, go for premium packages. The point is to expect as you pay. If you&#8217;re on a basic package, you will have to wait to see results. But if you want a quick jump to the top spot the more activities you sign up for the more quickly you will see results. Again getting these packages from a reputed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\"><b>SEO company in India<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the key.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Business_Goals\"><\/span>3.

Don&#8217;t pay for anything extra. At the same time don&#8217;t compromise as well. Buy an SEO package as per what you require and are expecting from your SEO campaigns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many of you think getting a good website is enough? Or do you think just doing PPC is enough? How many of you think SEO is all your business needs? Well, if one service was good enough, trust me others would have never gained any popularity over all these years. Let\u2019s accept that times have changed, the audience has changed &amp; so has their approach to making a decision. Anyone looking to buy a refrigerator doesn\u2019t just stop at finding the right website to buy one. In fact, the audience these days does their due diligence to find the right refrigerator that meets their needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, back to the point, please invest a good amount of time to identify your business goals &amp; what all platforms can help you achieve them. For example, the success of any e-commerce platform is dependent on how well the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/ppc-services-india.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PPC (Paid Advertising)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0&amp; SMO campaigns are executed. What are your business needs in that regard? What are you wanting from your SEO campaigns or website? Therefore, invest in an SEO package as per your business requirements and accordingly select an SEO service provider that caters to your requirements and goals.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, Read:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-optimize-video-for-better-ranking-on-google-search\/\">Video SEO \u2013 How to Optimize Video for Better Ranking on Google Search<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"\/blog\/top-10-seo-tools-that-every-webmaster-must-use\/\">Top 10 SEO Tools that Every Webmaster Must Use<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Quality\"><\/span>4.

I am sure no less than a branded one. Now, if you are so quality-conscious about the products that impact your lifestyle, why do we end up making careless decisions when it comes to our business? The business that helps us achieve our personal, economic &amp; professional goals. I have seen businesses that hire any company just because they are cheap. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mean if our consumption items are not based on the cheapest ones then why our business strategies are based on the cheapest option available? It&#8217;s quite common to find businesses that have opted for the cheapest vendor, The website goes for a penalty &amp; then they spend double the money to make the domain spam-free &amp; reactivate the quality efforts. Not to forget, the kind of time waste &amp; stress this activity brings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per imForza, 93% of online experiences begin with a search engine. Therefore, you can&#8217;t ignore SEO. Hence, you should hire a good SEO company that has effective SEO packages that work. They don&#8217;t come cheap but the quality they offer is beyond expectations. You should always choose quality. It&#8217;s okay if it&#8217;s a little over budget as long as it meets your business requirements. Just suit your requirements and go for a quality SEO package from a leading SEO company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10546\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10546\" class=\"wp-image-10546 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07123142\/Quality-Choose-Right-Packages-For-Your-Business.jpg\" alt=\"Quality - Choose Right Packages For Your Business\" width=\"1920\" height=\"850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07123142\/Quality-Choose-Right-Packages-For-Your-Business.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07123142\/Quality-Choose-Right-Packages-For-Your-Business-300x133.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07123142\/Quality-Choose-Right-Packages-For-Your-Business-768x340.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/07123142\/Quality-Choose-Right-Packages-For-Your-Business-1024x453.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-10546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Source<\/strong> &#8211; Wells Concrete<\/p><\/div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Cost\"><\/span>5.

I mean how are we expecting the business to turn into a Brand with just $500 a month? This is one of the most common mistakes that businesses make. My suggestion will be to invest 1\/3 of your budget in\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/web-design-development-packages.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">design &amp; development<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0while 2\/3 of your budget on marketing because creating a beautiful product alone doesn\u2019t bring traffic. In fact, creating a successful\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/digital-marketing-packages.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for it<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0promises traffic &amp; even an average website can deliver astonishing results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, effective SEO packages do cost a lot but they bring in a ton of results. However, some digital marketing companies are all talks and prices but bring no real results. Be careful of those ventures. Costly doesn&#8217;t always mean good. Do a thorough inspection of packages across the market and then choose a package that is good for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key here is to choose a package that is effective and covers all your business goals and vision. It should have all the services and more of what you require. Yes, it comes at a price and most likely won&#8217;t be cheap but if you wish to achieve more than your competitors you&#8217;ll have to spend a little more. But at the same time, there&#8217;s no point in buying a package that is costly and from an inexperienced company and doesn&#8217;t even offer the services that you require.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, be smart and look for a package that serves your needs the best. Costly doesn&#8217;t always mean good, cheap almost will never be good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>Watch Video &#8211; Different Kinds of SEO Packages &amp; Which One is for You?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/c0DmjDHQBlE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, these are a few points that I recommend to all the businesses to refer to &amp; possibly then take a decision on which SEO package should they go for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you got more questions pertaining to Digital Marketing, please feel free to ask me at mansi@ezrankings.com<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Selecting the right SEO pricing packages is always a tedious activity.

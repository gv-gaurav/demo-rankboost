class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launched in 2012, the Knowledge Graph or the Knowledge Base is just like any other information-rich result format of Google that displays useful content related to the user&#8217;s queries. It collects and shows related information from various multiple sources. The data could be related to a person, a popular place, a book, or an event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can observe the Knowledge Graph appearing on the right side of the screen (in the case of the desktop version). To give you a better perspective, if you search for a popular actor like Tom Cruise, the Knowledge Graph will return all the necessary information related to him.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, his profession right below his name, a brief introduction about him fetched from a trusted and genuine source, his social media handles (if there are any). Along with all these details, if you are searching for a person, the Knowledge Graph will also show some personal information which can include age, height, spouse(s), children, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If some upcoming project is linked to that person it may be a movie or a show, then it will also be shown in the Knowledge Graph. Along with the information you asked for, Google also presents you with some other suggestions that are searched by people. These suggestions come under the main result by the title of &#8216;People also search for&#8217;.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best part about these advanced results is that people also get to know about any interconnected information available regarding that person, place, or event. As per Google, Knowledge Graphs are useful as \u2014 They\u2019re designed to help you quickly understand more about a particular subject by surfacing key facts and to make it easier to explore a topic in more depth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Also, Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/core-web-vital-the-next-big-things-in-seo\/\">Core Web Vital: The Next Big Things In SEO<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_these_panels_are_generated_by_Google\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How these panels are generated by Google<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These smart panels are generated and updated automatically and Google has almost 500 billion facts regarding five billion entities in Google Knowledge Graph&#8217;s database. The results are been fetched by the automated algorithms of Google and many SEO experts believe that it&#8217;s quite a different algorithm as compared to other improvement algorithms. Below are some information formats that are shown in this type of result:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short summary of the search query with title<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A brief but description content about that entity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single or multiple pictures of the person, place, or the event<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key and popular facts about the search element<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media profiles if the person has any<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with all these things, Google also shows a tab of &#8216;people also search for&#8217; where we can see entities related to the above result. Along with this, you will also notice some special information about a person like their popular quotes, books, or songs. These entries are common if someone is searching for a popular artist.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sources_of_the_information_presented_in_the_Knowledge_Graph\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources of the information presented in the Knowledge Graph<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several sources from where Google collects the information for their Knowledge Graphs. According to the company, they collect information from licensed databases and web sources. You will find most of the time that the information is from Wikipedia pages because this site has the higher authority and information availability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the medical and health-related content that arrives in the Knowledge Graph, Google has once made a special statement. Over this kind of important information piece, Google closely works with medical associates to get vetted content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the content is regarding some popular events in which frequent changes are observed, then Google bots crawl the verified database with higher frequency to maintain relevance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"There_are_multiple_Knowledge_Graphs_also\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple Knowledge Graphs also<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When this feature was announced by Google, it was initially designed for the desktop version and as more people arrived on mobile search, the company also made changes. As the Knowledge Graph results are large in size, to optimize it for mobile devices, Google divided that entire graph into multiple smaller graphs that appear to be a single entity.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was a significant addition to the mobile version and as the voice search trend is on the verge of growth, mobile-based Graphs are helping the bots to fetch voice results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Making_changes_to_Google_Knowledge_Graph\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making changes to Google Knowledge Graph<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel that the graphs are showing irrelevant or outdated information, you can suggest the needful changes to Google. Below the graph results, you will find the option for feedback on the right bottom side. When you click on that, you will get the option to first pick a section that needs correction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you click on that section, you will then need to select what&#8217;s wrong what the result and add a comment to it. After you fill in your answer, you can submit it and the team members will review how the information displayed is outdated or not-useful. If the graph is related to the public interest, then you can expect a faster rectification from the search engine&#8217;s team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if a person or a company has claimed the panel, then they can directly contact Google&#8217;s team to ask for the needful changes. There are high chances that Google will verify and update information as soon as possible. This is because Google highly stresses improving the overall browsing experience of the users.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/how-to-do-competitive-analysis\/\">How To Do Competitive Analysis<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_you_need_to_do_for_arriving_at_Knowledge_Graph\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you need to do for arriving at Knowledge Graph<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a tricky question as Google has not shared any kind of guidelines for this unlike the other concepts like E-A-T.

Below are some factors that you need to keep in mind while optimizing your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Structured_data\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structured data<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organized information is highly vital for both users and bots.

When you are listed on the panel, it becomes easier for Google to understand your site in a much better way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, as the knowledge graph also has links to various other sources like social media links, important pages links, or books, it&#8217;s a free source of driving high organic traffic.

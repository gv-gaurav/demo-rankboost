When so many other search engines have already been released on the market, why is Apple&#8217;s search engine such a huge deal? Apple&#8217;s search engine might have a big influence because of Apple&#8217;s hegemony in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/mobile-ecommerce-facts-trends-statistics\/\">mobile device market<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On all platforms, Google has long been the Apple Safari browser&#8217;s default search engine. Recent industry rumors, however, indicate that Apple may be stepping up its search efforts to create a search engine that can rival Google, the market leader. What does this news signify for SEOs and Webmasters around the world considering that Apple devices are among the most well-known and popular electronics in the world?<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"This_is_what_we_currently_know\"><\/span><strong>This is what we currently know:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13640\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14111501\/Google-and-Safari-browser.jpg\" alt=\"Google and Safari browser\" width=\"843\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14111501\/Google-and-Safari-browser.jpg 843w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14111501\/Google-and-Safari-browser-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14111501\/Google-and-Safari-browser-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google paid Apple significant sums of money (billions of dollars) to continue being the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/in\/safari\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Safari browser&#8217;s<\/a> default search engine. Apple has a stranglehold on searches both Siri and Safari because their products are among the most well-known in the world, which directs users to Google. As a result, Google was able to control one of the key channels via which they might rule the search engine market in terms of both the industry&#8217;s reach and the potential number of advertising clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Apple will find it challenging to split from Google. Apple has plenty of experience creating technology, though. With the aim of unifying all hardware (Mac, MacBook, iPhone, and iPad) under the same programming and development environment, Apple just revealed that it is giving up on Intel CPUs. Where there is a will (and nearly $200 billion in the bank), there is a way. Before Apple can develop even a somewhat useful search engine, a considerable period will have passed. Take into account the challenge of finding talent capable of creating a workable replacement.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Do_We_Know_About_Apple_Search\"><\/span><strong>What Do We Know About Apple Search?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13825\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11121055\/Know-About-Apple-Search.jpg\" alt=\"Know About Apple Search\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11121055\/Know-About-Apple-Search.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11121055\/Know-About-Apple-Search-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11121055\/Know-About-Apple-Search-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The long-running rivalry between Google and Apple and the lack of competition in the search business have led to rumors that the Cupertino-based company would eventually put its toes in the water.<\/li>\n<li>The way Alphabet reports its results makes it difficult to estimate the worth of Google Search, but we do know that search accounts for the majority of its ad income, which reached $210 billion in 2021.<\/li>\n<li>If the reports are accurate, Apple has decided that it wants a share of the search market. However, why now? The business may assume that the iOS and Safari install bases have attained a critical mass that will enable it to support a real challenge to Google&#8217;s hegemony.<\/li>\n<li>For many years, Apple has benefited from a contract that guarantees Google&#8217;s place as the default Safari search engine and might be valued at up to $20 billion annually. According to documents submitted as part of a recent class action lawsuit, the conditions of this agreement also preclude Apple from introducing a stand-alone search tool.<\/li>\n<li>However, the billion-strong Safari user base would offer a strong basis on which to build if Apple were to break off its relationship with Google and introduce an alternative. And even without the possibility of additional antitrust laws, the business might be forced into this path.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s wrong to believe that having a wide audience ensures success. Microsoft, for instance, is in charge of the biggest operating system in the world, but it hasn&#8217;t made much progress in browsers or search. Apple would have to be confident that increases in advertising revenue will make up for the lost billions of dollars to unilaterally end its contract with Google.<\/li>\n<li>The speculated service might look nothing like a conventional search engine at all.\u00a0The fact that Siri may be the main gainer may indicate that the new product is intended to complement the answers provided by the digital assistant (powered by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google<\/a>) rather than to handle all queries like a typical search engine.<\/li>\n<li>There is a lot more information supporting the rumored change.\u00a0According to reports, Apple has intensified its efforts to find and hire candidates for jobs in the search industry.\u00a0Spotlight searches use &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-in\/guide\/iphone\/iph6f94af287\/ios\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siri Suggestions<\/a>,&#8221; which point users to the website, to fully circumvent Google.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_following_has_been_added_to_the_Applebot_help_page_most_recently\"><\/span><strong>The following has been added to the Applebot help page most recently:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13828\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11122817\/Applebot-Help-Page-Guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"Applebot Help Page Guidelines\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11122817\/Applebot-Help-Page-Guidelines.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11122817\/Applebot-Help-Page-Guidelines-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/11122817\/Applebot-Help-Page-Guidelines-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to confirm the addition of Applebot traffic?<\/li>\n<li>There have been more specifics added to the Applebot user agent, such as the distinctions between the desktop and mobile versions.<\/li>\n<li>Expanded Robots.txt regulations are now available.<\/li>\n<li>Added a paragraph explaining that they render pages similarly to Google in addition to merely crawling HTML.<\/li>\n<li>There is now a section on search rankings and the variables that affect how web search results are ranked.<\/li>\n<li>Applebot is now crawling more websites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Apple_Search_Engines_Functionality\"><\/span><strong>Apple Search Engine&#8217;s Functionality<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-13645\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14123941\/Apple-Search-1024x343.gif\" alt=\"Apple Search\" width=\"1024\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14123941\/Apple-Search-1024x343.gif 1024w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14123941\/Apple-Search-300x101.gif 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/14123941\/Apple-Search-768x257.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Apple is a business that places a high priority on building an ecosystem that links all of its products together.

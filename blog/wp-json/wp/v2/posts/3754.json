They are similar to radio or television shows, as they can be listened to or watched at any time and location. To understand how a podcast works, imagine a podcaster creating their show, using microphones, cameras, and recording software to record episodes. The episodes are then stored on a web server or podcast hosting platform, where they can be accessed online.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Podcasters create RSS feeds, which serve as notifications for new episodes. Subscribers to podcast apps or platforms subscribe to these feeds, and when a new episode is published, the app will automatically download and deliver it to the user&#8217;s device. This convenience and the wide variety of content have made podcasts a popular and educational entertainment for millions of people worldwide.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Create_a_Podcast\"><\/span><strong>How to Create a Podcast? <\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creating a podcast is an exciting journey that allows you to share your voice and passions with the world.

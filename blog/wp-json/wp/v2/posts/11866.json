Below are the fundamental factors that decide SEO printings:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Keywords\"><\/span>Keywords<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How many keywords you want to target and what the competition for those keywords will decide the SEO time and cost. It will take more time to rank a highly competitive keyword than the long-tail keywords and it will extend the SEO duration and cost.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Current_SEO_status\"><\/span>Current SEO status<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have just launched the website, then it would certainly take more time to boost visibility as the domain authority is low. So, to rank multiple keywords, it would easily take at least six months to start ranking. Contrary, if a website&#8217;s DA is high and the domain is also older, then it would take less time to rank the keywords.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_fast_you_want_to_rank\"><\/span>How fast you want to rank<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How fast you need your website to rank on certain keywords will also impact the SEO agency pricing in India. It is because, to rank a domain faster for keywords, SEO executives need to perform more frequent activities to outperform the competitors. Now, let&#8217;s jump to the main section.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cost_of_SEO_per_month_in_India\"><\/span>Cost of SEO per month in India<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of the professional companies will charge anywhere between $200 to $1300 per month. You can pick a suitable SEO package depending on your requirements. Whichever package you choose, it will cover all necessary aspects of search optimization. If you upgrade the package, it will increase the number of keywords, backlinks, content creation, and more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before you pick an SEO package in India, it&#8217;s better to have word with the SEO company to discuss your requirements and then buy the right package. You will easily find professional services within this range that will help you boost your company&#8217;s online visibility and organic traffic.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Tips_to_choose_the_right_SEO_company\"><\/span>Tips to choose the right SEO company<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you know SEO pricing per month in India, it&#8217;s equally important to hire the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\">SEO Company in India<\/a> that can deliver you results with confidence. Below are some quick points that you should consider while hiring the company:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Always ask for their portfolio so that you can check how effective their services are.<\/li>\n<li>Before hiring a company, you should be very clear about the business goals that you want to achieve with SEO.<\/li>\n<li>Ask the SEO firm to showcase SEO case studies that are relevant to your business.

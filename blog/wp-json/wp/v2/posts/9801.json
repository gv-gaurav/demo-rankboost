You need to make sure that you use a responsive web design that has a lower loading time, is attractive looking, and offers all the relevant information to your potential customers easily. You must display your contact information clearly to allow the customers to contact you conveniently.<\/li>\n<li><strong>SEO and AdWords: &#8211;<\/strong> Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) helps you to gain the coveted first-page ranking on SERP (Search Engine Ranking Page). With 98% of customers not going beyond the first page, having a second-page ranking is going to do nothing for your business. With the help of an SEO agency, you can promote your business in an efficient manner and attract more customers for your web design business.SEO is a time-consuming process that might take months depending on the competition in your business segment. This is where AdWords comes to your rescue. Leading search engines like Google or Bing offer this facility. It allows your ads to feature prominently above the search results and you need to pay only if a customer clicks on your link.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Offline Marketing: &#8211;<\/strong> Though this might sound outdated but is still a very effective technique. You use offline marketing techniques such as cold-calling, brochure distribution, exhibitions etc to scout for more clients for your website design business. This allows you to interact directly with the client and promote your services in a better manner.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media: &#8211;<\/strong> You can use social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram to look for newer customers for your business. A large number of business decision-makers are present on different social media platforms. You can approach them and offer your services. You can also get in touch with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\">Best SEO Company<\/a> or Content development agencies and formulate a profit-sharing mechanism with them to pass on leads to you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Freelancing websites: &#8211;<\/strong> This technique allows you to get business from even international clients. Freelancing websites such as Upwork, Freelancer, or Guru are excellent mediums to find new clients for your website design business. There are specific sections where customers post their website development needs and different freelancers bid to get that job. You can also participate in this process and acquire new clients by quoting a lower price. This way you will gradually move up the ranks of that website and become a preferred service provider.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Internet is a rapidly evolving medium and offers numerous opportunities for business owners to <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/tips-amplify-clients\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attract more clients<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

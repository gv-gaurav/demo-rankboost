But Bing Ads and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are now offering paid advertising.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">PPC relies on a model of internet marketing where advertisers pay a fee for every ad that is clicked. In other words, it\u2019s a way of buying visits to your site, rather than acquiring them organically.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why do businesses opt for PPC?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since PPCs are strategically targeted towards a relevant audience, they drive positive results substantially faster than the other options.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Statistics by seotribunal.com show that Pay Per Clicks (PPCs) have produced an 80% increase in brand awareness. So it is an excellent way of improving online visibility quickly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And WordLead claims that PPC visitors are 50% more likely to purchase something than organic visitors. When conversion rates are higher, it signals that PPC is influential in boosting website traffic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>So if everything is so rosy, why are companies using alternate methods?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it\u2019s clear that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/ppc-services-india.html\">PPC<\/a> is a powerful tool in digital marketing, it would be unfair to say that it\u2019s enough. One of the greatest drawbacks is that every click through PPC comes with a price tag. If you are paying to drive traffic, you are inevitably diminishing ROI.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, you need to keep a close watch on the performance of your campaign and eliminate non-performing ones. Otherwise, you may find yourself burdened with loses.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"But_what_about_SEO\"><\/span>But what about SEO?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">PPC can bring you faster results, especially if you have a high-converting product. But once you stop paying for clicks, the traffic stops. So if you are on a limited budget, you will need to test which keywords convert better and try SEO.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to omnicoreagency.com, Google is responsible for 96% of all smartphone search traffic, and 94% of total organic traffic. SEO does bring results, but it just takes a little time for the effects of getting into full swing. Even though you are not paying for any ads, the cost of SEO is indirect. You may, however, have to pay for services if you cannot do it yourself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s essential to provide exceptional content to rank well on SERPs. The objective is to make it to the first page. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brafton.com\/news\/95-percent-of-web-traffic-goes-to-sites-on-page-1-of-google-serps-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">95% of people never make it past the first page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a list of factors that will influence your rankings.

As part of this endeavor, it continues to invest in practices that help in bringing desired performance improvement and efficiency. User Experience has improved a lot, and it has been done through AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages Framework. AMP came into existence in 2015, and since then it has undergone a lot of development, promotion, and integration into existing publishing platforms. It has helped Google make big strides towards improvement in web standards.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">The AMP Framework is open source, but there was a time when it was considered as a proprietary format. During its launch, only a set of limited features was launched, but later also, it faced a lot of challenges getting widespread adoption. Currently, less than .1% support is available across the web for AMP. Thus, there are many challenges in its path, and it is time that suitable steps are taken to overcome them.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\"><strong>Benefits of AMP<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">It was found that websites that have adopted and embraced AMP have seen a marked change regarding conversions and performance. The user experience also saw a substantial change for the better. Besides performance, there are many other benefits and <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-speed-up-your-website\/\">advantages of AMP<\/a><\/strong> that has resulted in Google making optimal use of technologies and using AMP to integrate into open standards.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">Google is promoting AMP-oriented standardization work through a variety of WICGProjects. The ultimate objective is to extend support in some of the features like the Top Stories carousel to AMP-like content. When doing so, certain factors need to be considered.<\/p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify\">\n<li>It must match pre-determined user experience and performance criteria.<\/li>\n<li>Adherence to New Web Standards and its implementation<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">Some of the standards that have been proposed are Web Packaging, Feature Policy, Performance Timeline, iframe promotion and Paint Timing. Along with these features, the Chrome User Experience report had also been released by Chrome last year. These reports offer a lot of data that help in measuring user experience and performance regarding the web-wide real world.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">As per the post of tech lead of Google for AMP Project, MalteUbl, Google has decided to extend its support to the AMP Project. It will also help in its promotion and development. What the objective behind the integration of AMP features with open web standards is that it gels well with the overall mission of Google to ensure a better, robust and faster user experience. These features will be standardized thereby allowing developers to ensure its optimal utilization without completely embracing AMP framework. It will also help websites to appear on Google Search\u2019s Top Stories Carousel.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Malte Ubl, Tech Lead for the AMP Project at Google wrote:<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8299 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/26062143\/Malte-Ubl-Tech-Lead-for-the-AMP.jpg\" alt=\"Malte Ubl, Tech Lead\" width=\"646\" height=\"133\" \/><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif\"><span style=\"font-size: large\">Google is determined to make the most of AMP and learn from it.

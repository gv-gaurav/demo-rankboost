It is the most restrictive form of manual action and may lead to losing the organic presence. Such consequences frequently result in being removed from Google&#8217;s search results.<\/p>\n<p>Pure spam, or what might be called search engine spam, specifically refers to websites with unethical techniques performed through keyword stuffing, cloaking, or automatic content bulk production. They are full of content that delivers no useful information to users as all the content is created exclusively for search ranking purposes.<\/p>\n<p>When a website gets the Pure Spam Manual Action notice, it means that the Google team has reviewed its compliance with the guidelines set, and has ultimately concluded that the website is non-compliant and that it also does not provide a good user experience. Thus, it maintains fairness among sites and improves overall quality of search engine results for users.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the implication of a Pure Spam Manual Actions penalty is not just limited to websites, it can be also placed on individual pages or website sections that violate Google Webmaster Guidelines. As Google makes fighting spam and bettering user experience a point of daily focus, the search engine improves its algorithm and guidelines to catch and penalize these offenders.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YCXt1Z5nfpE?si=4OARBOBbwOmzjeJN\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Source<\/strong> &#8211; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@GoogleSearchCentral<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Are_Some_Reasons_For_a_Pure_Spam_Manual_Action\"><\/span>What Are Some Reasons For a Pure Spam Manual Action?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Pure Spam Manual Action is caused by one or several consequences of either or both of the number of issued warnings and the severity of the manual penalty imposed on web pages misusing certain techniques.<\/p>\n<p>The reasons for receiving this kind of spam can be for various things; for example, for hidden text or links, participating in link-exchange schemes, auto-generated content, or sneaky redirects, all of them will receive this spam. Spamming in all these forms is being considered as an under-hand and can bring a website to a position which is similar to a spammer.<\/p>\n<p>It may be also due to Keyword stuffing where irrelevant and excessive keywords to inflate the traffic of search is tried to manipulate. Furthermore, it is in contradiction with Google&#8217;s rules and differs dramatically from the requirement of providing helpful material.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Does_Google_Impose_Manual_Actions_On_websites\"><\/span>Why Does Google Impose Manual Actions On websites?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Manual actions serve as Google\u2019s way of enforcing its Webmaster Guidelines directly and upholding the quality of search results. These rules are designed to make sure that the Google user sees the content that is pertinent, helpful, and safe. The intention of penalties that Google applies to sites which do not adhere to these criteria is to prevent malicious or manipulative practices that could impact the quality of search results.<\/p>\n<p>This is particularly crucial in a digital era where the amount of online content is enormous and is increasing exponentially. In this way, manual actions act as a crucial weapon in Google\u2019s fight against spam, defense of users, and encouragement of a healthier online environment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, manual actions serve as evidence of Google\u2019s humanization in moderating content, which complements the efforts of the algorithm. Yet, the sensitivity of human judgment is irreplaceable in some cases, despite the fact that Google\u2019s algorithms are very sophisticated and effective in almost all Guideline violations, due to the difficulties of detecting some.<\/p>\n<p>With manual actions, Google can fix any problems that might still evade automatic detection, guaranteeing that its search engine will continue to be a good source of information. They also give webmasters detailed information about their website\u2019s compliance problems, hence, an opportunity for rectification and improvement.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Identify_If_My_Site_Has_Been_Penalized\"><\/span>How to Identify If My Site Has Been Penalized?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14801\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/16051110\/Manual-Actions-in-Google-Search-Console-1024x476.jpg\" alt=\"Manual Actions in Google Search Console\" width=\"1024\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/16051110\/Manual-Actions-in-Google-Search-Console-1024x476.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/16051110\/Manual-Actions-in-Google-Search-Console-300x139.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/16051110\/Manual-Actions-in-Google-Search-Console-768x357.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/16051110\/Manual-Actions-in-Google-Search-Console-1536x714.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/16051110\/Manual-Actions-in-Google-Search-Console-2048x952.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In Google Search Console, it is possible to verify the existence of the manual actions under the &#8216;Manual Actions&#8217; window.

But most of these shortcuts are close to black hat SEO methods, which break the rules of Google\u2019s Webmaster Guidelines, and can potentially damage your site\u2019s reputation and ranking in the long run. Focus on long-term SEO approaches that primarily concentrate on producing high quality and useful content and obtaining natural backlinks.

Junking key phrases, cloaking and spammy link building techniques are not only eliminated by search engines instantly; some people can get penalties or offend their search system. Put in practice a people-first technique by incorporating your keywords into your content without it looking clunky.<\/p>\n<p>While the optimization of quality is the key to maintaining the website&#8217;s reputation as one of the most credible sources of information, the possibility of getting backlinks from highly authoritative sources is increased.

Eventually, your site ranking and credibility will be boosted. Always verify periodically your site\u2019s privacy policy, terms of use, and other policies to make sure they align with those of Google.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Google_Pure_Spam_Manual_Action_FAQs\"><\/span>Google Pure Spam Manual Action FAQs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Does_fixing_just_one_page_result_in_the_removal_of_the_manual_action\"><\/span>Does fixing just one page result in the removal of the manual action?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>No, you should fix all the violations on your entire website to remove the manual action. These pages with problems can result in penalties for your whole site. Thus, with a holistic approach, focus on fixing all the pages that have attracted this penalty and ensure nothing is pending on your end.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Do_I_need_to_remove_the_relcanonical_tag_not_to_conflict_with_Googles_canonical_chosen_for_spam_pages\"><\/span>Do I need to remove the rel=canonical tag not to conflict with Google\u2019s canonical chosen for spam pages?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You should keep the correct use of rel=canonical tag as it is one of the key elements to help Google comprehend the structure of your site.

It may take a while, so be patient and continue following the rules of Google. Once your website is fully crawled by Google, your older rankings will start restoring, but there is no firm guarantee for the same.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Is_my_domain_lost_Should_I_start_from_scratch\"><\/span>Is my domain lost?

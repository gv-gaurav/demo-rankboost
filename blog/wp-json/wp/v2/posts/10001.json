However, in 2013 Moz\u2019s Domain Authority took over from PageRank and has over the years grown and today is the most widely accepted and trusted ranking metrics in the industry. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Domain Authority is a score or a metric that calculates the ranking of a website on a Search Engine Result Page (SERP). Hence, for an online business, it is indicative of the competitiveness of a website \u2013 when the DA score of one website is compared with that of its competitor\u2019s websites, it is easy to comprehend that the site with the higher score will feature higher on the SERP. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moz\u2019s DA scores on a scale of 1 to 100, where a score of 100 indicates the ability of the website to get top ranking, and 1 predicts the lowest rank. DA does not impact a ranking; it is merely a calculation or metrics that tells the user the probability of a website its capacity to outrank another. It is a tool merely that is used for predicting ranks on SERPs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_was_the_need_to_upgrade_Domain_Authority\"><\/span><b>What was the need to upgrade Domain Authority?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years Moz was facing criticism on primarily two aspects of its Domain Authority \u2013 <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The manipulation of links and search engine indexes by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\">SEO providers<\/a> who later got classified as Black Hat SEO service agencies.

DA scored -0.12 which was about 6% better than the Domain Rank, second to top the list.

The company also mentioned that the new version displays correct data and its scores should be used by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\">best SEO companies<\/a> henceforth. For website owners and webmasters there is not much to be concerned about because if they see a fall in their overall DA scores, they can be sure that even their competitors have registered a fall too. However, if there is a considerable fall in the scores, it means that the link profile of the site needs an immediate check-up. The new DA also keeps track of historical records \u2013 so if there is a fall over some time, there needs to be a campaign to tackle the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DA score can be checked by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mostlyblogging.com\/mozbar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moz Bar<\/a>.

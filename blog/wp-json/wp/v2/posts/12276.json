This particular content isn\u2019t talking about the product or services of the brand, but rather it is about the business\u2019s values, what it stands for, and the principles that it operates on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, branded content is used by companies to grow their businesses further. Many <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/growthrocks.com\/blog\/growth-hacking-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth marketing examples<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are available online to see how multinational companies use branded content to convert prospects and increase their reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branded content has provided success and engagement for businesses throughout the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is seen to be 22 times more effective than display ads and other forms of advertisement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most media groups have caught up on the wave, and 90% of them expect their branded content revenue to increase in the next 12 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why does branded content give such high numbers and positive results for businesses? What exactly does it do to consumers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well branded content isn\u2019t like any content out there online. It\u2019s not focused on products and services. When consumers read or see branded content, it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being sold to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branded content usually tells a story and evokes an emotional response. It\u2019s not boring, but rather it\u2019s entertaining, inspirational, and heartfelt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of content is focused on involving consumers and building trust between the brand and its market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know why branded content is received well by many, it\u2019s time to understand SEO copywriting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Is_SEO_Copywriting\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is SEO Copywriting?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO copywriting takes into consideration search engine algorithms and appeals to the readers. Basically, it is the practice of creating content that search engines can understand while at the same time it is engaging and something people want to read and share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses do SEO copywriting to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-brand-awareness\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase brand awareness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since ranking on search engines can greatly help a business scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how is SEO copywriting different from traditional copywriting?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between the two is SEO copywriting gives importance to keywords or keyphrases. While traditional copywriting only worries about how to make a reader act.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the content focuses on keywords, it increases the authority and relevance of your content and eventually improves its ranking in Google.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO copywriting is different from the rest because the content produced here is optimized with the use of keywords. The challenge here is to use the keyword as naturally as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reliablesoft.net\/best-digital-marketing-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital marketing course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or class will tell you that keywords and key phrases are important for any SEO endeavor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because it helps search engine algorithms know that your content is talking about this certain topic. When your content receives a ton of engagement and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/top-seo-company-in-india-drive-more-customers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drives a lot of traffic to your website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, search engines will see it as a relevant source of information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you\u2019re a real estate website. You created a blog post on how real estate agents can get a license in California, and you made sure that the keywords relevant to that topic were used naturally on your content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And after a few weeks of posting, the blog has been receiving many backlinks, traffic, and shares. Google\u2019s algorithm might see your blog as a good source of information when its users search for keywords like \u201cguide to getting real estate license in California\u201d or \u201chow to get a real estate license in California.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This then increases your chances of ranking on Google\u2019s first page.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Combine_SEO_Copywriting_and_Branded_Content\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Combine SEO Copywriting and Branded Content?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When branded content is combined with SEO copywriting strategies, it will increase the chance of the content being more successful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only is branded content more engaging and appealing to people, but with the added help of SEO copywriting, the reach of the content can be much broader.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When content ranks on search engines, it helps with the visibility of your business. This will ultimately land you more clients and convert prospects to paying customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine you have branded content that showcases how your business treats its clients and puts them as a priority.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only will it be received well by your customers, but it can also be globally seen due to the SEO copywriting techniques you\u2019ve included.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What was once content just for your audience is now exposed to millions if it ranks on search engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019ve seen the possible effect of combining these two elements, it\u2019s time to know how your content can land on the first page of search engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Create_Branded_Content_That_Ranks\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Create Branded Content That Ranks<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Optimize_your_branded_content\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.

Know when to use H1, H2, and H3. These headings make your overall content be organized and well structured. It lets readers understand what topics and subtopics you\u2019re going to talk about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Images and videos<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Using images or videos at the proper stage of your post are crucial to engaging the readers.

These are the ones that get the most likes and have the potential to be shared the most.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even advertisements of online events, products, and services now use emotions to hook their target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, people like sharing content that they relate to. They share videos, retweets, posts, and quotes if they seem it\u2019s talking to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A way to convey emotions through content is by storytelling. It\u2019s a proven strategy to appeal to your customer\u2019s emotions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storytelling is always compelling because people use stories every day. They hear stories from people, and they also tell stories to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So when creating branded content, you can tell how your brand relates to your audience or how your business understands them. Tap into a particular emotion of theirs and elicit a customer response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When including a story in your content, it shouldn\u2019t be about your brand alone. Involving your audience makes it engaging. Asking questions or talking about a shared experience can be enough to hook them or pique their interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you might question how tapping emotions help your content rank?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, if people relate to your content or see value from it, they won\u2019t hesitate to share it on different platforms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the keywords you\u2019ve used and the engagements the post gathered, search algorithms might see that as a good source of information about your brand, topic, and keywords relating to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Try_A_Different_Approach_For_Every_Platform\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.

Being one of the most used pay-per-click platforms that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PPC services<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use and having 1.84 billion daily active users, it\u2019s just too big of a number to pass up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Facebook\u2019s platform, you\u2019ll have more leeway to write well-thought-out branded content to reach your customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can showcase how your business operates and strives to reach a great customer experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also gives you more room to explain your political or environmental stance, which can sometimes greatly affect your customer\u2019s perception of your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Facebook\u2019s share function, your customers can do all the marketing for your branded content. If you\u2019ve hit the right emotional strings and connect with them emotionally, you can have a viral post at your hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about branded content on Facebook through the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/formedia\/solutions\/branded-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they\u2019ve written.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Keyword_Frequency\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Keyword Frequency<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword frequency refers to how many times a keyword has been mentioned in your content. This ranking element is a bit tricky since no one knows the ideal times a keyword should be mentioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though marketers don\u2019t know the ideal keyword frequency, this shouldn\u2019t stop you from testing things out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/goaura.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aura<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an Amazon repricer tool for Amazon sellers.

Keyword stuffing is the practice of loading a web page with keywords that the page is trying to rank for. This makes the whole page spammy, too promotional, and unnecessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engines condemn this type of action. They don\u2019t want spam web pages on the first page of their search result. A lot of marketers believe that doing keyword stuffing can do more harm than good.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Leverage_Your_Top_Distribution_Channels\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.

These channels can be blogs, emails, or social media platforms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The top distribution channels may differ for every business and brand. That\u2019s why some businesses invest time and money in market and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.optimalworkshop.com\/how-to-quickly-and-easily-run-user-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To know your top distribution channel, you can check your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/avidonmarketinggroup.com\/blog\/5-important-content-metrics\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content metrics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and compare each channel. Objectively seeing how your campaigns are doing will give you an idea of what distribution channel works best for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some might see that emails are still their go-to distribution, while others find more engagements on Facebook or Twitter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your competitors are using other platforms, it doesn\u2019t mean that you are also tied to using the same platforms. It all boils down to where your audience engages with your content the most.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflow Inventory<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even though most businesses in their industry use Facebook, they know that they get the most interaction on Youtube. So rather than creating long posts or blog content, they use videos and leverage Youtube since it\u2019s the top video platform out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Advantages_of_Creating_Branded_Content\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advantages of Creating Branded Content<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"I_It_is_noninvasive\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I. It is noninvasive<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good characteristic that branded content has is it\u2019s not invasive. It\u2019s an ad\/content that is not \u201cin your face,\u201d and that\u2019s unwanted by many.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is unlike traditional digital ads like banner ads that are displayed on the sides of websites which can affect a user\u2019s web experience. Or those sponsored ads that pop out of nowhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When creating branded content, you\u2019re naturally attracting people to check and see your business out. You\u2019re not forcing it on news feeds and timelines. It doesn\u2019t put your business in a bad light for your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An excellent example of this is how <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mixam<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> casually placed a graphics video that talks about the customers\u2019 frustrations in their industry and how their business can make it easier for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This branded content was not intrusive and can only be seen if the customer visits their website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"II_It_puts_your_business_in_a_better_brand_positioning\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">II. It puts your business in a better brand positioning<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand positioning refers to how a business is identified and seen by consumers. It is the act of designing the company\u2019s image to occupy a place in the target market\u2019s mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is all about new technological innovations, the image you want to portray is a brand on top of all new innovative technologies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose your company is about being updated on the new <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diet and muscle-building<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> research. In that case, the image should be the most knowledgeable and reliable source of information in this space.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand positioning alone can be the sole factor that your market chooses you over your competitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re able to connect with your audience and convey emotions through your branded content, this will put your business in a better position with your customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can think that their money is well-spent with your business; it also can be that doing business with you will exceed their expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most branded content showcases its value to its market. Businesses use it to let people know that \u201cthis is how we do our business\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"III_Increased_consumer_confidence\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">III.

And when your business shows that what you advertised in your branded content is true, your market\u2019s confidence in you will increase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased consumer confidence will do wonders for the bottom line of your business. Remember, a confident customer would be willing to spend more than a doubtful one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your business lives up to the expectations you\u2019ve set in your branded content, this will also result in customer loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer loyalty is a powerful thing to achieve since these customers are the ones who will keep coming back to do more business with you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just look at how <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key West Aloe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> made a customer remember their products even if the purchase was five years ago.

Through this content, the business can showcase who they are as a company and what makes them different from their competitors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the additional help of SEO copywriting, the visibility of that branded content can be increased. It will have a chance to rank on search engines that global users can see. This exposes the business to the broader market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using the strategies above to optimize branded content, you\u2019re on your way to making those search engine algorithms find your content.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Author_Bio\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Author Bio<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burkhard Berger is the founder of Novum.

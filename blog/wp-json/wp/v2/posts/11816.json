With more brands moving their sales and marketing online, social media will be flooded.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many social media platforms are also preparing themselves for this. For instance, there are now Instagram features that enable shopping: Instagram Live shopping and Reels shopping. Also, the recent partnership between TikTok and Shopify and Walmart live-streaming shopping events all point to social media as a more significant marketplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2024, eCommerce is going to be a significant trend.

As a brand, you should pay more attention to social media e-commerce and social media marketing. Put in the work to optimize all your social media profiles across the different platforms as it will serve you for a long time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because your social media profiles are where most customer journeys will start before it ends in your online store or website. This is now a much shorter journey than usual. All it takes is for a prospective customer to discover your social media profile, such as Instagram. They could be buying from you directly without even exiting the app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also take the pain to create educational videos about your products, shoppable posts, and make your brand message clear on different social media platforms. All of these contribute to building loyalty from your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Virtual_and_augmented_reality_trends\"><\/span><b>Virtual and augmented reality trends<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual reality and augmented reality grew very rapidly on social media as a result of the pandemic. They are going to remain popular in 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the enforced lockdown and social distancing order, people needed new ways to communicate and interact more meaningfully with themselves even though it is virtual. Virtual reality was the solution to that problem. VR was able to provide people with this level of virtual interaction. It gave people the feeling of togetherness when interacting with others as though they were together. During the social distancing period, when people were expected to stay at home, it was what they needed. It started gaining popularity ever since and will continue like that in 2024. We are starting to see social media platforms work toward incorporating the technology even better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality works very similarly, too, and the same events lead to the popularity of this technology. The fact that it doesn\u2019t need additional hardware apart from the smartphone makes it more accessible to the public than VR. It also works very well with photo filters and similar experiences which people use on social media platforms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the dissertation service the UK, augmented reality experiences are very interactive, which is why it is effective for engagement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is now a social media trend that fans are buying into as they create AR filters to promote their new products and encourage interaction with their audience.

The option to shop with AR allowed customers to try products through their phone cameras before making purchases virtually. Although Instagram implemented this on its platform in 2019, it became a significant trend in 2022 thanks to the pandemic. Businesses continue to drive sales with this technology, so it is not going anywhere in 2024.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In planning your strategy for social media in 2024, Virtual Reality and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/augment-reality-walk-blend-real-world-virtual-world\/\">Augmented Reality<\/a> are two trends that you must implement in your strategy.

Two-way communication always helps take your posts to the top organically. Social media algorithms are programmed to show people contents relevant to them &#8211; and paid ads that are targeted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an online community that engages your content with shares, comments, and likes will help you amplify your content even better to channels that your customers trust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to social media experts, algorithms are programmed to favor people, not brands. Understanding this fact soon enough will help brands put more emphasis on people in their social media activities. This will enable them to create a people-first strategy for social media that influencers, customers, and employees amplify.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><b>Conclusion<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to note the social media trends and practices for 2024 as a brand.

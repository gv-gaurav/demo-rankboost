While Shopify Payments is the default payment method for Shopify stores, Shop Pay works alongside it to streamline the checkout process. Shop Pay serves as a wallet for online shoppers, allowing them to make quick payments and even offering payment installment options.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, Shopify Payments is an online payment processor that merchants can use to receive payments. However, unlike Shop Pay, Shopify Payments cannot be used as a personal wallet for fast checkouts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although some Shopify stores opt for alternative payment providers such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Amazon Pay, Shop Pay is exclusively compatible with Shopify Payments. When visiting a merchant&#8217;s website, customers will find the regular checkout option for processing cards through Shopify Payments. In contrast, Shop Pay is represented by a purple button and is available in the Express Checkout section.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_ShopPay_Pricing\"><\/span>What is ShopPay Pricing?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_14466\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-14466\" class=\"wp-image-14466 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/25102159\/What-is-ShopPay-Pricing-1024x169.png\" alt=\"What is ShopPay Pricing\" width=\"1024\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/25102159\/What-is-ShopPay-Pricing-1024x169.png 1024w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/25102159\/What-is-ShopPay-Pricing-300x50.png 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/25102159\/What-is-ShopPay-Pricing-768x127.png 768w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/25102159\/What-is-ShopPay-Pricing.png 1505w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-14466\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source &#8211; shopify.com<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Shop Pay itself is free to use, it requires Shopify Payments to be installed to function.

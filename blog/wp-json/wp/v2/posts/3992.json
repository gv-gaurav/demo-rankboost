Two types of penalty you can expect from Google in such a case. If Google releases some new updates regarding the changes in the current algorithm, then your site can lose its rank if it has elements that do not match those new strategies. On the other hand, there are Google employees who can manually penalize your website for various reasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get rid of Google penalty; whether it is manual or algorithm based; you need to monitor the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Webmaster Tool<\/a> account in a constant manner.

You should track your links and contents continuously to ensure that all are relevant and not duplicate.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Duplicate Content With Inappropriate Keywords<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are websites that publish duplicate contents with inappropriate keywords. Nothing can save them from being penalized by the major search engines and having the rank drop. The only thing can solve this problem is a complete change of the content of the website including the Meta Tags. You should make each and every sentence of your website fresh and original.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The use of the relevant, accurate keyword should be done to get rid of the rank drop issue.

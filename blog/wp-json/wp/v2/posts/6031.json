SEO also takes a bit of time in researching the keywords along with implementing the strategies. With PPC you only need to pay if someone clicks on the ad and also views your website. With PPC is that you have to locate keywords that do not come with high bids, but are popular at the same time, this will actually allow you to increase traffic without paying high prices.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Complexity\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Complexity<\/b><\/span><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">Well, the truth is that SEO is undoubtedly very complex, but PPC is very easy to understand and implement. In SEO a website that is optimized properly will get a good rank but a lot of factors have to be balanced out. However, unlike a <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/paid-advertising-predictions\/\">PPC strategy<\/a><\/strong> with SEO, you do not have pay dime for clicks<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Predictability\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Predictability<\/b><\/span><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">It is no secret that PPC is very predictable but the cost of running a PPC is increasing daily, but when it comes to SEO things are a little unpredictable as you do not always know how the keywords are going to perform. The only similarity they seem to have is that they require a lot of research in locating keywords.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Which_one_should_you_go_for\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Which one should you go for?<\/b><\/span><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">The truth is both are very effective provided you know what to do. The method you select will totally depend on your preference, campaign and niche. To cut things short with an SEO strategy you have to research if you want to succeed with a PPC campaign you have pay all the way. You may have to spend quite a bit with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/ppc-services-india.html\">PPC Services<\/a> but to cut down on the cost you may use certain biddable keywords and so you can keep the cost under control.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Make_are_careful_selection\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Make are careful selection<\/b><\/span><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">Now both of them have their positives and negatives so you really have to know what your requirements are.

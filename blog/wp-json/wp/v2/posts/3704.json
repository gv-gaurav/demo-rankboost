Desktop-based browsing has seemingly taken a backseat with mobile browsing trends taking a dramatic surge.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Such transformations created the demand for unsurpassed user experience in mobile sites. And mobile site owners are fighting tooth-and-nail to drive UX.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<h3>Introducing AJAX<\/h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">Although there are quite a few technologies helping in driving User Experience, there is nothing like AJAX. The term \u2018AJAX\u2019 is the acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript &amp; XML, which helps you update certain parts of your web page, without eliminating DOM. In simple words, DOM refers to the HTML architecture of a web page.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As the result, there is no need of creating complete page loads, thus ensuring faster responses to visitor inputs.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By building your website on AJAX platform, you will surely attain new heights in web development. On that note, let us have a look at the art of deploying AJAX in your web development projects.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Effective User Experience increasingly depends on speedy responses. Now that is something unachievable in standard websites. Most of the standard websites keep their users waiting while interacting. What occurs as the consequence is the reloading of DOM into the browser.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If the loading pages are from the same website, this entire process is going to be quite wasteful. And that is what happens most of the times.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefits of AJAX<\/h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">AJAX doesn\u2019t depend on the unloading and loading of DOM. It offers a steady and regular stream of information unobstructed by DOM.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With the help of AJAX, web applications have the opportunity of sending data asynchronously to and from the server, without affecting the existing page\u2019s display.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With the help of AJAX, web applications have the opportunity of sending data asynchronously to and from the server, without affecting the existing page\u2019s display.<\/p>\n<h3>How does it help?<\/h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">While you navigate through numerous locations in Google Maps, AJAX technology makes sure there is an interrupted flow of crucial information, available for immediate use.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">While uploading content in web applications or transitioning between web pages, AJAX ensures contextually appropriate user inputs. Users are also eligible to get detailed views.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Once you are successful in gaining control over website loading, the content will offer a unique opportunity of designing page transitions, visual cues, and loading animations that help users comprehend site hierarchy. And it also creates avenues for unleashing creativity.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">However, websites based on 100% AJAX loading will not give any feedback on the progress of the loading process. That might lead to undesired confusions, where visitors might be left waiting for hours, without any response.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Going by the discussions in the article, it is pretty evident that AJAX is undoubtedly the future of web development. Without this particular technology, web pages might have to undergo reloading, thus hindering speed to a great extent.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By relying on 100% AJAX framework, web developers will end up creating sites that offer customized and personalize experiences to users.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With mobile innovations taking the tech domain by a storm, there have been considerable changes in the browsing behavior of individuals.

They might have a problem that you can solve, but without the right marketing tactics, there\u2019s no way you can reach them. In brand tracking terms, we would refer to this as the \u2018discovery phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We might use \u2018push marketing\u2019 tactics to get our brand in front of people. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencer marketing has been proven to be particularly effective with Generation Zs and Millennials, with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/econsultancy.com\/reports\/influencer-marketing-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61% of consumers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> aged 18-34 claiming an influencer has \u201cswayed their purchasing decision\u201d.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with more established companies can foster trust.

It can also be a reliable quick win while you work on SEO in the background.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what kind of data can we measure at this stage? We can cross-reference campaign launches with data on visitor clicks, purchases, likes, comments and shares to get a better impression of how these new customers are discovering and interacting with our brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Consideration\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consideration<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, your customer is more familiar with your brand, so it\u2019s time to engage in a little introspection. How is your brand perceived by this customer, and what can you do to sway his or her decision?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a brand tracking perspective, this is still part of that crucial discovery stage, where we\u2019re learning more about our customers. We might use a tool like heatmap tracking to determine how our customers are engaging with the brand based on user segments. For example, we could break audiences down into age groups, gender or education level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/how-to-calculate-measure-the-seo-roi\/\">How To Calculate And Measure The SEO ROI<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We might also conduct primary research to get feedback from our prospective audiences. For example, we can use surveys to ask our audience questions about the product. Even better, we can ask them what would make them choose our product over a competitor\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might seem underhand, but monitoring a competitor\u2019s performance is absolutely crucial to gain a better understanding of your own. You could <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.convinceandconvert.com\/digital-marketing\/monitoring-competitors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider tactics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer perception analysis: determining whether feedback on a brand is positive, negative or neutral. On a larger scale, we can use artificial intelligence and natural language processing to look for \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019 language and find out more about how our competitors are perceived. So, if hundreds of customers are complaining about slow delivery times on social media, that\u2019s a weakness we could exploit by examining <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.velocenetwork.com\/social-media\/key-elements-to-spice-up-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">elements of building an effective strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword analysis: by looking at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.osiaffiliate.com\/blog\/ecommerce-keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what keywords they rank for<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in search engines, and more importantly, where they fail to rank, you can guide your own organic or PPC strategies.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With better awareness of both your customers\u2019 sentiments and your competitors\u2019 failings, you can build trust and guide people through to the all-important purchase phase.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Purchase\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the customer is ready to make a purchase. Your brand is on the radar and it\u2019s all about delivering the right product or service that will solve their problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaign data really comes into its own here. For example, you might have a vast product range that suits multiple audiences \u2013 sports clothing for children, men and women, let\u2019s say. You understand that a \u2018one-size-fits-all approach isn\u2019t going to cut it: an adult male\u2019s wetsuit isn\u2019t going to attract a female tennis player.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User segmentation helps us to drill down and create more targeted campaigns that influence purchase decisions. But in a broader sense, brand tracking can also offer some pleasant surprises \u2013 you might discover new audiences you\u2019d never considered approaching before. Again, we return to the whole review, refine and redo methodology, taking insights and turning them into actions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Retention\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retention<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you thought the buying stage was valuable, then the retention stage is even more so. Did you know that it can cost up to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.outboundengine.com\/blog\/customer-retention-marketing-vs-customer-acquisition-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">five times more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to acquire a new customer than it can to retain an existing one?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why it is so important, as brand marketers, that we consider this an integral part of the customer journey. We might consider monitoring \u2018spikes\u2019 in brand awareness campaigns and drilling down into those audiences. What led them to a successful purchase, and how can we convince them again?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this stage, it\u2019s all about taking big data and applying it to the individual. So, if you\u2019re an office stationery supplier who gained 100 customers off the back of one campaign, it\u2019s time to nurture them and re-engage when they might need to re-order. We can analyze metrics such as new and returning users to calculate buying cycles, then send out targeted campaigns, such as email promotions, to encourage loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Advocacy\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advocacy<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing could outvalue purchases and retention, right? Well, advocacy could certainly take it one step further. At this stage, not only are our customers retained; they are brand evangelists. They will happily talk about our brand without incentive; they will wear our labels and recommend our products to others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where brand association really matters. What do our customers think about when they hear our brand name out loud? Amazon might be associated with speed or convenience, for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can use brand preference tools to analyse what makes our product stand out against our competitors, and play on this to foster even greater loyalty. It could be anything from enhanced UX to a quirky design or an ethical focus. Once we understand why our customers buy from us, we can use it to power advertising campaigns, build up <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/referralmarketingschool.org\/affiliate-marketing-best-practices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">affiliate marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and improve the quality of our product.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"3\">\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Every_stage_counts\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every stage counts<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might not be targeting everybody, every customer counts. One individual could provide insights into your brand perception, your strengths and weaknesses, your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/instasize.com\/blog\/how-to-measure-performance-of-your-social-media-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campaign performance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and your growth potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s essential to remember is that brand perceptions vary at every stage of the funnel, so we need to leverage data analytics to get the best from our customers.

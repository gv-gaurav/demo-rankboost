This is what&#8217;s proving to be costly for retailers online which is largely why Retail search was introduced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some of the major reasons why Google Retail Search was developed because:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_User_Intent\"><\/span>1. User Intent<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Our search habits have evolved. Earlier, it was about searching the precise terms. But as people started relying more on Google, they started searching for longer, broad-term search queries or even for closely related search terms.<\/p>\n<p>It became essential for the search engines to start understanding the search intent of a user and accordingly, present search results.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12736\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/08075709\/User-Intent-search.jpg\" alt=\"User Intent search\" width=\"1060\" height=\"707\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/08075709\/User-Intent-search.jpg 1060w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/08075709\/User-Intent-search-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/08075709\/User-Intent-search-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/08075709\/User-Intent-search-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1060px) 100vw, 1060px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>However, on retail websites, shoppers still struggle with search. They often have to type the perfect search query to get relevant results. Therefore, traditional search techniques don&#8217;t work for contemporary Retail websites.<\/p>\n<p>No individual likes going through the hassle of changing search queries just to get relevant search results. People want that search engines should understand their intent, and present relevant results quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, searchers expect personalized product recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>With Google Retail Search, it&#8217;s now possible to offer advanced search to users that can make it easy for them to discover new products.

This is because it was a simple way for those watching to be able to distinguish between the villain and the hero. In these films the hero was always wearing the white hat, while the villain donned the black one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This terminology has since been adopted and used in various industries over the years, especially when it comes to security.

which ones you are going to opt for. The term <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services-india.html\">white hat SEO services<\/a> just means that these expert follow only the set rules. They would be the ones who are using the best and only the ethical tactics that are in place and follow all of the guidelines set by the search engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who are called black hat means that they would use some of the riskier practices and tactics that search engines don\u2019t recommend. This means that these tactics would work, but at some point they would stop working. This can be simply going against the various guidelines that are set up to other dangerous activities that would affect your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question then becomes who determines who is good and who is bad? This isn\u2019t per a legal problem since not following the guidelines isn\u2019t something that is illegal. However, if you are caught using some of the most nefarious SEO tactics like hacking, then you might be looking at some legal issues. There isn\u2019t a governing body that sets and determines what is ethical when it comes to SEO and the guidelines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_Bad_and_Good_Practices\"><\/span><b>What are Bad and Good Practices?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are only a few rules that are set in SEO and those are the ones that are given by the various search engines to the experts. This is because when the day ends this is still their platform and they get to decide the various conditions that need to be met in order to be featured. There are some algorithms that are used by these major search engines and they have been honed and developed carefully over the years. This was done to help fight the unhelpful and obvious manipulations in terms of the search results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The algorithm is there so it can catch the websites that are going against what they think is the spirit and credibility of the system for rankings. This means that the search engines are determining what is considered illicit behaviour and what is thought to be fair play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/website-taxonomy-everything-to-know\/\">Website Taxonomy \u2013 Everything To Know<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/google-play-vs-app-store-where-should-you-launch-the-first-mobile-app\/\">Google Play VS App Store: Where Should You Launch The First Mobile App<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Guidelines_Set_by_Google\"><\/span><b>Guidelines Set by Google<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that Google is famous for is having some pretty clear guidelines for webmasters that are used all over the world by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services-india.html\">professional SEO<\/a> These guidelines can help to identify just what could land your website in trouble if it is discovered. Google calls these the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/adsense\/answer\/1348737?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quality guideline<\/a>s\u201d, which tells about the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behaviour\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These guidelines have a wide variety of activities that are mentioned like \u201cscraped content\u201d, \u201cdoorway pages\u201d and \u201ccloaking\u201d.

There are going to be some nuances in regards to the guidelines that might not be clear, but are you attempting to meet these guidelines or are you finding a way to work around them? If you are working to reach them, then you are a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/white-label-seo-services.html\">White Label SEO Reseller<\/a> expert, but if you are trying to get around them, then you are going to be considered black hat.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_a_Gray_Hat\"><\/span><b>What is a Gray Hat?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to SEO there are plenty of opinions in regards to just what a grey hat SEO expert is. According to the definition set up by Google it is one who uses a mixture of both the white and black hat techniques and it is a tactic that is either of the categories, but with some changes to the methods that the search engines work that could change later. It is clear by this definition that gray hat is somewhere in the middle and it isn\u2019t exactly ethical, but neither is it completely wrong.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a blurred line and it isn\u2019t something that you would want to willingly tell Google that you are up to. This isn\u2019t something that you should face an automatic penalty for either since it isn\u2019t a bad practice in general, but it is being done so that you can get ahead when it comes to the rankings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Do_These_Definitions_Matter\"><\/span><b>Do These Definitions Matter?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially the use of the terminology of gray, black and white hat is arbitrary. What these definitions do is help to keep the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/white-label-seo-services.html\">white label SEO experts<\/a> in line when they are working on the websites that aren\u2019t owned by them. The techniques that are used by the black hat experts deliberately goes against the guidelines set by the search engines and it can carry risks. This means that the sites that are using these methods can be penalized by a partial or outright ban from any search engine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is extremely serious if your website isn\u2019t one that you own since it can cause any business to lose their largest revenue stream if it can\u2019t be found through the organic and main source.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Activities_are_Part_of_What_Category\"><\/span><b>What Activities are Part of What Category?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many types of activities that you need to think about when it comes to SEO and you should consider what is white, black and grey for each, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Link_Building\"><\/span><b>Link Building<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guidelines that Google has set for link building states \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any links intended to manipulate PageRank or a site\u2019s ranking in Google search results may be considered part of a link scheme and a violation of Google\u2019s Webmaster Guidelines.\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you are hoping to be in the white hat category, then you need to make sure that you are creating valuable content that the users will use to educate, inform or delight them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, this content can be easily used as a link builder to become a resource for other websites while if you are adding your website link to the various blog comments you are posting, then it becomes black hat. However, if you are thinking about using the content in order to purely gain links, which is against the guidelines set by Google. You would need to think about whether or not this content is going to be valuable and relevant to what readers are searching for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Quality_of_Content\"><\/span><b>Quality of Content<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the guidelines set by Bing it says, \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Websites that are thin on content, showing mostly ads or affiliate links, or that otherwise redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend not to rank well on Bing. Your content should be easy to navigate, should be rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are doing the right thing your content should be written to delight the reader, answer their questions and aid their navigation. It would rank higher because it is helpful and relevant and optimized to allow the right audience when searching and it is written for the needs of the users first. If you are using a black hat techniques, then the content would just be a doorway page, which is copied from various websites that doesn\u2019t add any value and it would be full of keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would mean that the copy is just there so that the search engines can find it rather than being there for the users. However, if your content doesn\u2019t have an overwhelming number of keywords while still being written just for a higher page ranking, then it can be considered gray hat. This would also consider that the page might be useful to the visitor, but it doesn\u2019t have a lot of text or value.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_They_Differ\"><\/span><b>How They Differ<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing that you need to consider when it comes to this is how they differ and it isn\u2019t just in the definitions, but also in the rewards and risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Risks\"><\/span><b>Risks<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what implementing any of these techniques can carry risks and black hat ones have a clearer risk of using manual actions. If you are found going against the guidelines of the search engines, then you can be penalized by some or the majority of your content being removed from the search engines. Another risk that you need to know about is that some white hat techniques might not work well enough for your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because there are some industries that are extremely competitive and it isn\u2019t as easy to reach the same rank as other competitors that might be using these black hat methods. However, if you want to reach the highest rankings, then you need to consider what you are doing since if you are playing by all the rules you might not ever reach reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The techniques that are used by grey hat experts runs the risk of facing penalization later, especially if the methods that are being used are borderline. This is problematic because you never know when the algorithms are going to be changed or when they are going to start cracking down on that technique.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Longevity\"><\/span><b>Longevity<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another area that you need to consider is longevity since not all technique are going to be useful for long periods. There are some techniques used by black hat experts that could be effective for the short-term, but when they are discovered, then the effects and ranking will also be short-lived. The techniques that have the best change of standing up against the various changes and time are the ones used by white hat experts, while the grey hat ones would be questioned and looked at harder over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot that you should consider when you are thinking about grey, white and black hat SEO methods and techniques. If you are hoping to get the best ranking possible by following the guidelines, then it is vital that you are finding a white or grey hat company. If you don\u2019t want to face any penalizations or problems, then ensure that you are avoiding the black hat type for your business.

Here are some of the top KPIs for SEO that you are going to want to look at that will measure the progress, effectiveness and performance for your current strategy. Knowing the important ones to track can make a huge difference in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services.html\">SEO for your business<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"In_Google_Analytics\"><\/span><b>In Google Analytics<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every single owner of any business needs to be overly familiar with the <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/web\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Analytics tool<\/a> since this is a free tool. However, the majority of owners only use it at the basic level and there are plenty of KPIs that you can track through it, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Organic_traffic_and_the_completion_of_your_goals_and_conversions\"><\/span><b>Organic traffic and the completion of your goals and conversions<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversions are just one of the most important KPIs because you can get plenty of visitors, but nothing matters if they don\u2019t end up converting. You can track the completions of your gal by going to the conversions tab &gt; Goals &gt; Overview &gt; Add Segment &gt; Organic traffic &gt; Apply. This would then show you a report where you can see all of the SEO KPIs like goal value, goal completion, goal conversion rates and much more, so you can see your ROI on organic traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few other things to look at during this time includes not only the conversions, but also the bounce rate and the pathways to the top conversions. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/4-ways-youre-driving-away-your-web-traffic\/\">bounce rate<\/a> will tell you how many visitors are leaving the site after only looking at a single page. This is vital because it can show you the journey of the visitor and that is an indication that something might be wrong with the site.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bounce_rate\"><\/span><b>Bounce rate<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are going to want to be aware of the exact number of how many people are leaving the website after looking at just one page. This could be because of a wide variety of reasons like copy, content, design or something else entirely. You should make sure that you are checking out the data and then trying to figure out why the users are leaving after looking at a single page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most often the top causes of bounces are incoherent meta description copy or ad copy, which leads them to believe the page is about something else only to find it different when they land on the page itself. Make sure to keep the website simple to understand, cohesive and easy to use since this will help to keep users looking at the site and viewing other pages as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Top_Bounce_pages\"><\/span><b>Top Bounce pages<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are going to want to know just what pages are causing visitors to leave your website so you can fix it. Make sure that you are in the organic traffic section and then choose Behaviour &gt; Site content &gt; Exit pages and this is where you are going to find the vital information. This will help you to look at these pages carefully and work on fixing them so the visitors are staying and visiting other pages as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Lifetime_value_of_the_users\"><\/span><b>Lifetime value of the users<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another KPI that you need to be looking at is\u00a0 the value of any user based on their performances in their lifetime. To see this you have to go to Audience &gt; Lifetime value and here you are going to be able to view the various metrics. This is going to show you a detailed and informative view of the potential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/improve-your-revenue-using-video-ads\/\">revenue<\/a> of all customers that are coming through organic searches. This would be accurate if you have entered the full value that you are placing on the customer\u2019s conversion and how many orders you believe they would place with your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/googles-core-web-vitals-a-new-ranking-signal\/\">Google\u2019s Core Web Vitals \u2013 A New Ranking Signal<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"\/blog\/redirects-and-their-impact-on-seo\/\">Redirects And Their Impact On SEO<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"In_Google_Search_Console\"><\/span><b>In Google Search Console<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also want to know about the other services that are free that you can get from Google, especially those offered to webmasters. These would allow them to check the indexing for the web pages and optimize them better. Here are some of the KPIs that you can find using this tool, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Total_number_of_all_organic_clicks\"><\/span><b>Total number of all organic clicks<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are using the search console you can see the reports that will tell you just how many clicks your website got and what search terms were used. This would also help you to see which of your landing pages are generating and bringing in the highest number of clicks as well as the devices that might be sending more traffic to you. You can look at the search volume using a wide variety of filters like Google Trends, Ads campaign and even keyword explorer.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Report_for_mobile_usability\"><\/span><b>Report for mobile usability<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that you need to keep an eye on carefully is the amount of traffic that you are getting from mobile devices since this has quickly surpassed any desktop traffic. You need to ensure that they are getting the best experience so they will keep coming back to your page. You can find this information in Search Traffic &gt; Mobile Usability and here the report would be shown, which shows any issues that users are facing. It will also show you the URLs that you have that aren\u2019t showing up properly on the mobile device screens and even the accelerated mobile pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The accelerated mobile pages is also called AMP and it is one of the most vital KPIs for SEO this year. This helps with your pages loading faster and you can check out the loading speeds of all of your pages by visiting Search Appearance &gt; Accelerated mobile pages and here you can see the URLs that are having issues. Make sure that you are checking this regularly so you can address the issues and see what pages are having severe problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Crawling_errors\"><\/span><b>Crawling errors<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crawling errors are one of the most crucial, yet overlooked, SEO KPI ever and you need to see what URLs aren\u2019t accessible by the Googlebot. You can do this by going to Crawl &gt; Crawl errors and then checking out the report of what is listed. The more often you do this, then the easier it is going to be to fix the errors so they can be crawled and indexed by Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is going to help Google cache the various pages that are listed on your website and this can help to increase your ranking. However, if they aren\u2019t indexed, then Google can\u2019t show it to the viewers, so you are going to want to ensure that this is done so you can increase your ranking. If this isn\u2019t completed, then you don\u2019t know how much traffic you are missing out on, so go ahead and check this report regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Other_Important_SEO_KPIs_to_Know\"><\/span><b>Other Important SEO KPIs to Know<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are also going to want to know what other SEO KPIs there are to know that aren\u2019t found in the Google console. Here are a few more to consider, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Target_keywords_and_the_organic_ranking_they_hold\"><\/span><b>Target keywords and the organic ranking they hold<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most common KPI, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t important and this is where you identify the various main keywords that are sending the majority of the traffic in the direction of your website. You can get to the top of the rankings for your keywords if you are starting with a clear goal, which means creating your content in a manner that will answer the questions of the user. This will help you to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wincher.com\/blog\/how-to-track-rankings-to-boost-organic-traffic\" target=\"_blank\">rank higher<\/a>, especially if you were writing the content based on the keywords themselves instead of questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Page_Speed\"><\/span><b>Page Speed<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loading speed of your page became critical back in 2017 and it will continue to be so in the upcoming years. Starting in July 2018 the loading speed of your website started to become a factor in your ranking during mobile searches. Google just wants the users to have only the best experience possible and this means that you need to keep them happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that your page is loading quickly since Google is going to give the websites with the best experiences for the users with a higher ranking. This matters when it comes to your number of conversions as well as the price that you are going to pay when using Google Ads. The faster your website loads, then the more the users and Google will be pleased, so make sure that the site loads quicker than your competitor\u2019s pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Meta_data\"><\/span><b>Meta data<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the data that will tell the user about the data that they are going to be clicking on. This is vital for the search engines so they can validate whether or not the content is going to be relevant to what the user is looking for. There are numerous applications for these meta tags and not all of them should be used in the <a href=\"\/blog\/10-essential-seo-strategies-for-e-commerce-sites\/\">SEO strategies<\/a>. However, you should ensure that you are using the right length for your page title meta descriptions and it shouldn\u2019t be less than 300 characters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are all important KPIs and you are going to want to make sure that you are using them on your website to increase the organic traffic that you are bringing in. Ensure that you are aware of all of these and that they are being implemented on your page if they aren\u2019t already in use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that you have your SEO goals set and that you are using these SEO KPIs to help you reach them, which is the first step in being successful. These can help you to figure out how well your website is doing as well as telling you where you would need to improve. Ensure that you are monitoring them on a regular basis so you can see the issues and fix them before they become bigger problems.

Advertise on multiple platforms:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the best ways to drive more traffic to your website is to advertise on multiple platforms. This will allow you to reach a wider audience and get more exposure for your business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can advertise on Google, Bing, Facebook, and other platforms. Several big brands use this strategy and it has proven to be very effective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another less-known benefit of advertising on multiple platforms is that it can help you lower your costs. This is because you can bid on the same keywords on different platforms and this will help you get a lower cost-per-click (CPC).<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Use_negative_keywords\"><\/span>2. Use negative keywords:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Negative keywords are a very important part of any PPC campaign. They help you filter out searches that are not relevant to your business and this can help you improve your click-through rate (CTR) and lower your costs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, if you sell women\u2019s clothing, you would want to use negative keywords such as \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d, \u201cboy\u2019s\u201d, \u201cgirl\u2019s\u201d, etc. This will help you filter out searches that are not relevant to your business and this can help you improve your CTR and lower your costs.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Use_relevant_keywords\"><\/span>3. Use relevant keywords:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another important aspect of any PPC campaign is to use relevant keywords. These are keywords that are closely related to your product or service. Using relevant keywords can help you improve your CTR and get more leads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, if you sell women\u2019s clothing, you would want to use keywords such as \u201cwomen\u2019s clothing\u201d, \u201cdresses\u201d, \u201cskirts\u201d, \u201ctops\u201d, etc. This will help you target searches that are more likely to convert into sales.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Use_ad_extensions\"><\/span>4. Use ad extensions:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ad extensions are a great way to improve your CTR and get more leads. They are extra pieces of information that you can add to your ads, such as your phone number, address, website URL, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adding ad extensions can help you improve your CTR because they make your ads more relevant and informative. This can help you attract more clicks and get more leads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the popular ad extensions that you can use are call extensions, location extensions, site link extensions, etc. Along with this, if you run a local business then message extensions can also be very beneficial as people can easily contact you through your ads.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Launch_remarketing_campaigns\"><\/span>5. Launch remarketing campaigns:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remarketing campaigns are a great way to get more leads from people who have already shown interest in your product or service. These are people who have visited your website but did not convert it into a sale.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With remarketing, you can show them targeted ads and this can help you get them to come back to your website and make a purchase. This is an excellent way to boost your business sales and get more leads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, when you focus on remarketing, you can significantly lower your costs.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Design_mobile-friendly_landing_pages\"><\/span>6. Design mobile-friendly landing pages:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mobile-friendly landing pages are very important because a large majority of people use their smartphones to search for products and services. If your website is not mobile-friendly, then you will lose a lot of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make sure that your website is responsive and that your landing pages are designed for mobile devices. This will help you improve your CTR and get more leads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, Google and other search engines are constantly working towards making mobile-friendly websites a ranking factor, so it is important to keep this in mind.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Try_lookalike_or_similar_audiences\"><\/span>7. Try lookalike or similar audiences:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are struggling to get leads, then you can try lookalikes or similar audiences. These are people who have similar interests and demographics as your existing customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can create a lookalike audience on Facebook and Google. This is a great way to reach more people who are likely to be interested in your product or service.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Set_a_realistic_budget_for_running_ads\"><\/span>8. Set a realistic budget for running ads:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most important aspects of any PPC campaign is to set a realistic budget. You need to understand how much you can afford to spend on your campaign and this will help you make better decisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make sure that you track your results so that you can see if your campaign is successful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are not seeing any results, then you need to re-evaluate your budget and make changes accordingly. PPC can be a very effective way to get more leads, but it is important to understand how much you can afford to spend before you start your campaign.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9_Write_benefit-driven_copy\"><\/span>9. Write benefit-driven copy:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you are creating your ads, it is important to write benefit-driven copy. This means that you need to focus on the benefits that your product or service can offer. This will help you attract more clicks and get more leads.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, if you are selling a new type of toothbrush, then you would want to focus on the benefits that it offers, such as being more effective at cleaning teeth or being more comfortable to use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You need to make sure that your ads are relevant and informative so that people will be interested in clicking on them.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"10_Use_the_responsive_search_and_display_ads\"><\/span>10. Use the responsive search and display ads:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Responsive search and display ads are a great way to improve your CTR and get more leads. These are ads that adjust themselves according to the device that they are being viewed on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, if someone is viewing your ad on a mobile device, the ad will be different from the one that they would see on a desktop. This is a great way to improve your click-through rate because you are providing a better user experience.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"11_Dive_into_AB_testing\"><\/span>11. Dive into A\/B testing:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A\/B testing is one of the most effective and result-driven ways to improve your PPC campaigns. This involves showing two different versions of your ad to two different groups of people. You can then track the results to see which version is more effective.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a great way to improve your campaigns and make sure that they are as effective as possible. A\/B testing can help you make small changes that can have a big impact on your results.<\/p>\n\t<section class=\"pack-call-to-action first\">\n\t  <div class=\"container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-12 text-center\">\n\t\t\t<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_top_3_paid_ad_positions_get_46_of_the_clicks_Are_you_there\"><\/span>The top 3 paid ad positions get 46% of the clicks.

How Can I Budget My Campaigns?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans:<\/strong> PPC marketing campaign cost must be decided on the bid, targeting, and ad quality. A bid is an amount you&#8217;re willing to pay for an ad click and it is with this price that you enter a PPC auction. A bidder always plays less than the actual bid amount. Keep in mind that higher bidding is one of the factors for a top ad rank.<\/p>\n<p>Targeting includes ad demographics, the area, keywords, etc. The more aggressive and competitive the targeting is, the more the cost.<br \/>\nAd quality is another parameter and if the ad quality is superior compared to other ads, the bidder can end up paying less and still win the top spot.<\/p>\n<p>A bidder must understand all these factors before budgeting their campaigns.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world of marketing is always changing and evolving, which means that the strategies used to work for marketing your business may not be as effective anymore.

Reels can be up to 30 seconds long and can be edited with creative filters, effects, and audio.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike TikTok, Reels are not set to disappear after 24 hours. They live on your profile alongside your other posts, which means you can gain long-term engagement from them.<\/p>\n<p>Witnessing the growing popularity of this feature, numerous brands are now using Reels to promote their products and services.<\/p>\n<p>But with so much competition, how can you make sure your Reels stand out and get the engagement you want? The answer lies in timing as just like with any other social media platform, the key to success on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/5-easy-ways-to-create-engaging-instagram-ads\/\">Instagram<\/a> is to post when your audience is watching you.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you have opted for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/social-media-marketing-services.html\">social media marketing services<\/a> or you have an in-house team, you need to know about the ideal timings.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_69 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title \" >Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" aria-label=\"Toggle Table of Content\"><span class=\"ez-toc-js-icon-con\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"eztoc-hide\" style=\"display:none;\">Toggle<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-icon-toggle-span\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"\/blog\/best-time-to-post-instagram\/#Is_there_really_an_ideal_time_to_boost_engagement_on_Instagram\" title=\"Is there really an ideal time to boost engagement on Instagram?\">Is there really an ideal time to boost engagement on Instagram?<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3' ><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"\/blog\/best-time-to-post-instagram\/#Day_1_Monday\" title=\"Day 1.

However, several marketing companies have figured out an ideal time for every day for posting reels on Instagram. All the below timings are as per the US Pacific zone:<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_1_Monday\"><\/span>Day 1. Monday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>12 PM<\/strong> is the <strong>ideal time<\/strong> as people are getting back to work after the weekend and checking their social media feeds. <strong>On<\/strong> <strong>Mondays<\/strong>, people usually take a break from work around lunchtime, which is why this time slot gets more engagement.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_2_Tuesday\"><\/span>Day 2. Tuesday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>9 AM<\/strong> is the <strong>best time<\/strong> as people are getting settled into their work week routine and checking social media feeds in the morning. As people get on to their work tasks, engagement usually drops off in the afternoon.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_3_Wednesday\"><\/span>Day 3. Wednesday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>11 AM<\/strong> is the <strong>ideal time<\/strong> as people are mid-week and more likely to take a break from work to check their social media feeds. <strong>On Wednesdays<\/strong>, people usually start to wind down from work in the afternoon.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_4_Thursday\"><\/span>Day 4. Thursday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Same as <strong>Wednesday, 11 AM<\/strong> is the <strong>best time<\/strong> to post. Thursdays are also loaded with events and after-work plans, which is why engagement usually drops off in the evening. Thus, it&#8217;s better to post in the morning.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_5_Friday\"><\/span>Day 5. Friday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>2 PM<\/strong> is the <strong>ideal time<\/strong> as people are taking a break from work and checking social media before the weekend. <strong>Fridays<\/strong> are also when people are more likely to make plans for the weekend, which is why engagement usually drops off in the evening.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_6_Saturday\"><\/span>Day 6. Saturday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>9 AM<\/strong> is the <strong>best time<\/strong> to post as people are checking social media before starting their day. <strong>Saturdays<\/strong> are usually a slow day for engagement as people are busy with errands and other activities.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Day_7_Sunday\"><\/span>Day 7. Sunday:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>7 PM<\/strong> is the <strong>ideal time<\/strong> as people are winding down from the weekend and checking social media before going to bed. <strong>Sundays<\/strong> are usually a slow day for engagement as people are busy with errands and other activities.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_get_most_of_your_Instagram_reels\"><\/span>How to get most of your Instagram reels?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The first step is to understand your target audience and when they are most active on social media.

With some of the leading ecommerce stores embracing this bots technology, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/\">digital marketing<\/a><\/strong> is truly entering into a unique phase. However, we must take a look at the chronological development of these smart digital agents.<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_69 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title \" >Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" aria-label=\"Toggle Table of Content\"><span class=\"ez-toc-js-icon-con\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"eztoc-hide\" style=\"display:none;\">Toggle<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-icon-toggle-span\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"\/blog\/digital-marketing-entered-the-age-of-the-agent-layer\/#From_Then_To_Now\" title=\"From Then To Now\">From Then To Now<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-4' ><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-4'><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-4' ><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-4'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"\/blog\/digital-marketing-entered-the-age-of-the-agent-layer\/#1_Say_%E2%80%98C_for_Conversation\" title=\"1.

Even if brands wished to convey anything special to the target audience, there was hardly anything more than social media to do so. In a nutshell, there was a serious lack of personalized approaches.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It is these gaps that automated bots aim to fill up. With their emergence, users will have the opportunity of seeking help from virtual assistants and smart agents.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Say_%E2%80%98C_for_Conversation\"><\/span><strong>1. Say \u2018C\u2019 for Conversation<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Try answering this question. How would you feel to enter into a brick-and-mortar store and help yourself in the shopping endeavor? Will it be better than having a highly knowledgeable store assistant by your side?<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Perhaps, the answer is no. It\u2019s highly convenient to seek help from store helpers assisting shoppers day in and out. They will render useful assistance in identifying your specific requirements, thus helping you achieve a great shopping experience.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Increased_Convenience\"><\/span><strong>2. Increased Convenience<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Digital bots extend useful assistance in ways more than one. Forget about moving into a single shop; imagine entering into a shopping mall with numerous stores in it. How about meeting a sales associate right at the time you step into the mall? The person can help you identify your particular interests along with introducing you to other sales bots.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As the result, you will gain access to products or services you actually need. However, the prime emphasis should always be on conversation. Bots are there to build effective communications with you.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Discovering_Your_True_Needs\"><\/span><strong>3. Discovering Your True Needs<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">Purchasers will land up their preferred choices, only if they are capable of utilizing the power of bots. You might ask about the availability of a certain product, but that will be of little use. Rather, the approach should be different. You must frame questions that revolve around your topic.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Say, for instance, your purchase queries must be something like \u2018What do I need to build a deck? In simple words, the emphasis should be on striking, engaging conversations.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Conversations happen to be of great use when it comes to product sales and purchase. With smart and intelligent shopping agents striking effective conversations with you, you will enjoy an unparalleled shopping experience, sans the intrusion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the grand launch of its Messenger platform, Facebook entered into an entirely new marketing arena.

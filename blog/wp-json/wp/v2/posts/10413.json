id=\"What_is_Nofollow\"><\/span><strong>What is Nofollow?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The first thing that you need to know is exactly what nofollow is and how it is used. It is used on links and it is an attribute from HTML which would tell Google which links are trusted and which ones aren\u2019t. Originally it was designed in order to combat the spam comments on blogs. However, it later evolved to be used for advertising links and for links that were generated by users which couldn\u2019t be trusted 100%.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Googles_Official_Statement\"><\/span><strong>Google\u2019s Official Statement<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><em>The official statement and announcement from Google on this change are as follows:<\/em><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>\u201cWhen nofollow was introduced, Google would not count any link marked this way as a signal to use within our search algorithms. This has now changed. All the link attributes \u2014 sponsored, UGC and nofollow \u2014 are treated as hints about which links to consider or exclude within Search. We\u2019ll use these hints \u2014 along with other signals \u2014 as a way to better understand how to appropriately analyze and use links within our systems.\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Do_Publishers_Get\"><\/span><strong>What Do Publishers Get?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One might question what the publishers are going to get with these new attributes for nofollow. However, there are numerous reasons that you might not want to add these new link attributes. Alan Bleiweiss, who is a forensic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/ecommerce-seo-services.html\">SEO auditing<\/a> consultant had this to stay about the changes:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>\u201cThere\u2019s ZERO incentive to adopt the new nofollow changes. If it has a direct, significant impact on rankings, sure. Forced change. Except Google claims is not going to. The cost of revamping entire CMS\u2019s &amp; training teams to accommodate this, outweighs the motive.\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Important Points Raised by Alan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When Alan started to talk about these changes he pointed out a few important items, including that publishers aren\u2019t getting any incentive to use these new link related attributes. Also, the publishers aren\u2019t going to see any benefit in terms of seeing a boost in ranking and any changes being implemented outweigh the perceived benefits.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Changes_Being_Absorbed_by_Digital_Marketing_Community\"><\/span><strong>Changes Being Absorbed by Digital Marketing Community<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>AimClear\u2019s VP for Content Strategy Mark Traphagen has commented on just how the search marketing community is attempting to understand all of the changes. He stated, \u201cBecause Google not only redefined how it uses nofollow but also added two new link attributes (sponsored and UGC), I can understand confusion among SEOs about what needs to be done if anything. \u201c<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sites_Getting_Deserved_Link_Equity\"><\/span><strong>Sites Getting Deserved Link Equity<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Julie Joyce, who founded Link Fish Media and is an expert in link building, had brought up a viewpoint that is interesting. The change that Google is making has opened up the possibility that some websites can now get link equity along with a deserved boost in rank. Cyrus Shepard was also asked about his opinion and he stated, \u201cI think this is good news for link builders, and the link graph overall, but a potential headache for publishers. Even though most links still won\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d, this won\u2019t stop folks from rushing to create comments, UGC(user-generated content), and Wikipedia edits with the hope that they might count, no matter how slim the possibility. Rumors and misinformation will abound. Folks are already confused. Good for Google for doing this, but the industry is going to need more clarification before this thing shakes out.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Criticism_Response_from_Google\"><\/span><strong>Criticism Response from Google<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When <a href=\"\/blog\/why-how-to-secure-your-website-with-https-protocol\/\">HTTPS<\/a> came into play Google had forced HTTPS to be adopted through demotion of the sites that didn\u2019t put this into play and giving boosts in rank to those who did. Danny Sullivan, who is the SearchLiaison for Google took to Twitter where he said that Google isn\u2019t going to force anyone to implement these new attributes.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Sullivan also stated,<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe two new attributes are voluntary choices for those who find it useful to be more granular. It\u2019s a *choice* and we don\u2019t need to put \u201cteeth\u201d into a choice. Use them. Don\u2019t.

These attributes are going to help Google since they can now use them in calculating links. The sponsored link attribute would give a strong hint to Google to not use it for page rank.<br \/>\nMark Traphagen also spoke about how the sponsored link attribute could benefit Google and he said:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>\u201cI guess a \u201csponsor\u201d link more directly expresses why the link might not pass authority than \u201cnofollow.\u201d \u2026It seems clear that \u201cnofollow\u201d was being used for too many diverse purposes.\u201d<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_UGC_Links_Would_Be_Trusted_by_Google\"><\/span><strong>Why UGC Links Would Be Trusted by Google<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google stated that the UGC (User Generated Content) nofollow links are going to be treated as if they were hints from September 10, 2019. They said,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cAll the link attributes, sponsored,\u00a0UGC (User Generated Content) and nofollow, now work today as hints for us to incorporate for ranking purposes.\u201d <\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This attribute would let Google know that these links could be useful when it comes to ranking purposes. This would come across in the numerous forums that are available online that Google can determine on their own.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Google_Changed_it_to_a_Hint\"><\/span><strong>Why Google Changed it to a Hint?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are many people who are saying that there aren\u2019t as many opportunities for building links because nobody is creating them.

Adding the links from the site into the ranking calculations done by Google could bring in a new method to improve the signal of the links, which could trickle down and increase the link calculations.<br \/>\nWhen speaking about Wikipedia links Andrea Volpni from Wordlift stated, \u201cMost of today\u2019s NLP\/NLU (Natural Language Processing\/Natural Language Understanding) is based on models trained on Wikipedia, links included. Some of the NLP we use is also dependent on links found in Wikipedia\u2019s article. The value of these links is strategic.

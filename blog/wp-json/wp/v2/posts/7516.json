Differences, however, do exist between these two tools. If you delve deeper, you will see differences are existing between those tools. Demographics, features, and number of users are the main points of difference. Facebook has established itself as a <a href=\"\/blog\/marketers-can-use-social-media-marketing-services\/\"><strong>Social Media Platform<\/strong><\/a> for quite some time. Sharing and communicating are the twin objectives. On the other hand, Linkedin has established itself as a connector tool for business professionals. So you can see that Linkedin has a restricted approach whereas Facebook is open to anybody. Linkedin is appealing to the commercial world because the environment is suitable for white collar job holders and corporate recruiters. It has established its name as a business networking platform.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Preferences_of_your_customers\"><\/span><strong>Preferences of your customers<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It is essential to know the social media preferences of your customers. Owners of organizations should have a clear grasp of the idea about the platform where the customers are spending most of their times. You can find that out through various means. The easiest and cheapest means is by asking. Nowadays, there are paid services available in the market. These service holders note down the email ids of the customers and provide you with a profile of network information. As soon as you have an idea about their preferences, you can start your interactions with them directly. It acts like words of mouth advertising. The moment you are visible on your customers&#8217; list of friends, other friends will take note of it, and this will pave the way for increased sales opportunities.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Get_professional_help\"><\/span><strong>Get professional help<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Businesses build their identity on <a href=\"\/blog\/who-is-the-best-choice-for-paid-marketing-google-or-facebook\/\">Facebook<\/a> pages with the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/social-media-marketing-services.html\">Social Media Marketing Services<\/a>.

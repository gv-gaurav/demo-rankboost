When you are interacting with your prospect for the first time, you need to ask a lot of questions. However, you have to keep in mind that you should not ask unnecessary questions. Asking questions will help you know more about the requirements of your client.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Questions_To_Ask\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Questions To Ask?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the question is, what questions do you need to ask? There are different questions asked by different SEO analysts or SEO agencies. For a basic SEO proposal, you need to ask more about the requirements of the client. The requirements, goals and budget are the three important and necessary factors that you will require in your proposal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_2_Use_A_Template\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 2: Use A Template<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second step is to use a template. There can be many templates available for SEO proposals online. But you can also prepare one template for yourself. There are free templates also, that you can just download and use for your proposal preparation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Choose_The_Best_Template\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How To Choose The Best Template?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may worry about how to choose the best template? The best way to choose a template is to compare all of them. You have to compare the format, design, usability and more importantly customization. Choosing a customizable template will allow you to make it look like your brand identity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_3_Give_100_In_Summary\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 3: Give 100% In Summary<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe some experts will tell you to write a summary at last. But you have to add a summary at the beginning of your SEO proposal. Maybe your prospects don&#8217;t have enough time to go through the complete proposal. In such cases, prospects will look for the summary. So you need to write a summary which reflects your proposal completely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_4_Add_Deliverables\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 4: Add Deliverables<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you deliver to your client if he\/she avails of your service? You must have to include everything in the SEO proposal that you will be delivering. All the services, tasks, tools, reports should be mentioned clearly in the SEO proposal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_5_Keep_Everything_Under_A_Timeline\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 5: Keep Everything Under A Timeline<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time is crucial for any SEO campaign. Your prospects may need to know what time it will take to complete an SEO task. They may also need to know what time is required to show results. All these things will be mentioned in the proposal if you keep everything under a timeline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_6_Take_Them_Into_Your_Confidence\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 6: Take Them Into Your Confidence<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to take your prospects into your confidence. You have to tell them that you are capable enough to complete all the SEO tasks mentioned in the SEO proposal. Don&#8217;t add anything to a proposal that you cannot achieve or accomplish in reality. Some SEO agencies mentioned a lot of things in the SEO proposal. But when it comes to reality, they fail to provide all the services. In such cases, SEO agencies lose confidence in their clients. That is why you need to take them into your confidence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_7_Make_Pricing_Offer_Transparent\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 7: Make Pricing Offer Transparent<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing is very important for your SEO clients. They want everything under the budget. You have to keep their budget in mind while creating an offer for them. No doubt you can make an offer which exceeds their budget. But you have to be very transparent about the pricing. Also, you can give them alternate offers if they don&#8217;t like your major offer price or cost.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_8_Get_Legal_Side_Prepared\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 8: Get Legal Side Prepared<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal side of your proposal is also very important. It makes everything clear and transparent. Along with this, it gives an authentic look to your SEO proposal. The legal side of your SEO proposal will include the terms and conditions of your service. Along with this, you have to add an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/guide-to-electronic-signatures\/\" rel=\"\u201ddofollow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">E-signature<\/a> to your proposal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"STEP_9_Send_It_To_Your_Prospect\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 9: Send It To Your Prospect<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now your SEO proposal is ready to go. You have to check all the parts of the SEO proposal again carefully. A mistake in your proposal can make it less impressive. Mistakes and errors will give you a bad impression. So check it and send it to your prospects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing an impressive SEO proposal takes time and dedication. But more importantly, it needs proper format, content, style and appealing tone. All of these things make an SEO proposal look more attractive and impressive. What is the goal of your SEO proposal?

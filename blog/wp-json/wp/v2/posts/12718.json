updates in recent times which has made this feature even more powerful. Now, even for bus and train trips, ETA or estimated time of arrival is possible to know with live location sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Also, an individual can share how much longer the bus or train they&#8217;re traveling on is going to take to reach a destination. Thus, family and friends can know exactly where you are with location sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the Google maps feature allows live location sharing with other Google contacts as well as with someone who uses Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Hangouts.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who_Can_Use_Google_Map_Location_Live\"><\/span>Who Can Use Google Map Location Live?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to select who all can find your location and even decide the duration for which they can see your live location. Moreover, you can also choose to share a location with someone just for once.<\/p>\n<p>However, sometimes location sharing does not work and that could be because of the following reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You&#8217;re in a country where sharing location is prohibited.<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;re too young to share the location.

The same thing applies while reviewing service pages.<\/li>\n<li>Bloggers will also have to disclose the real reason for writing free product reviews. As users wish to know about whether the content is sponsored or not, bloggers must admit that they have got free gifts from the company.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, Google also asks bloggers to create unique and highly compelling contents.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Aftermath\"><\/span><strong>The Aftermath<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p align=\"justify\">While this platform was very particular about its announcement and declarations, it was unworthy of some bloggers to ignore its guidelines. As the most undesired result, Google also issued manual signals for those users. Let\u2019s find out what occurred in the aftermath.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">John Mueller from Google issued some highly noteworthy comments in this context.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Importance_of_rel-nofollow\"><\/span><strong>1. Importance of rel-<\/strong>nofollow<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"justify\">According to the Google representative, free product or service reviews must have links in a rel=nofollow format.

Most of them contain crucial product information, thus enhancing customer experiences. However, bloggers need to modify links present in these posts to prevent them from passing PageRank.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If you are one of those bloggers, it is high time to take necessary action and modify links, thus helping Google eliminate manual actions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investigations revealed that businesses were using certain specific keywords to create fake listings.

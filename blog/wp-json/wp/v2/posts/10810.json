It\u2019s essential to building and nurturing consumers\u2019 trust and loyalty. And once that trust is broken, it can be challenging to get it back.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_It_Strengthens_Your_Relationship_With_Your_Clients\"><\/span><b>#2. It Strengthens Your Relationship With Your Clients<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sincere messages, such as Dove\u2019s campaign for real beauty, can enable your clients to see your brand as one that truly understands them and their needs. Moreover, putting your customers\u2019 well-being in the spotlight makes buyers feel like your company truly cares for them, and they are not just another figure to benefit your bottomline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from emphasizing how your products benefit customers, you can also highlight your companies\u2019 commitment to causes such as environmental protection or employee welfare. By promoting messages that your clients can resonate with or consider important, you can eventually win new and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/redstagfulfillment.com\/customers-seasonal-buyers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lifelong customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who are invested in your success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_It_Puts_You_Above_Your_Competition\"><\/span><b>#3. It Puts You Above Your Competition<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s consumers are bombarded with messages about product features. If you are relying solely on those \u201cunique\u201d features to set you apart from your competitors, you lose that advantage the moment your competitors start adapting or improving on those components.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What your competition cannot easily duplicate are the emotions you can draw in, the loyalty you win, and your business decision to promote transparency in your processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers may easily forget your products\u2019 features, but they won\u2019t easily forget how you\u2019ve made them feel. When consumers trust you and support the causes you believe in, they will easily remember your brand whenever they need to make a purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, they may start recommending you to their family and friends or producing user-generated content (UGC) to help promote you or your causes. As such, you don\u2019t only win customers\u2019 loyalty, but you also have people who are willing to market your products and services for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_3_Components_of_Brand_Authenticity\"><\/span><b>The 3 Components of Brand Authenticity<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his article, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.intercom.com\/blog\/brand-alignment\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intercom SVP Shane Murphy-Reuter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, points out that the dynamic you see in the best relationships&#8211;an alignment in values, decisions and actions, and outward behavior&#8211;are also essential for your business.

Below are five ways to achieve this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Ensure_Consistency_and_Continuity_in_Your_Visual_Contents\"><\/span><b>1.) Ensure Consistency and Continuity in Your Visual Contents<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be able to create a compelling visual brand identity, you need to be consistent in your elements including images, colors, fonts, and layouts. This applies to all your business materials, from your offline or printed items such as <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-identify-the-perfect-package-for-your-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product packaging<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signages, wall decals, booths and displays, to <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online content<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as your website design, blogs, lead generation pages, social media posts, videos, and ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stick_to_your_brands_color_palette\"><\/span><b>Stick to your brand\u2019s color palette.<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The palettes you choose will be influenced by your logo\u2019s design or color, your industry, target audience, and the brand personality you wish to project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you\u2019re creating an online store catering to children, you may incorporate bright hues when presenting ideas to your client. If you\u2019re <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.websitebuilderexpert.com\/building-websites\/how-to-build-a-business-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">building a business website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a law or investment firm, consider <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pitching your designs<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that gravitate toward subdued or traditional tones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Choose_the_images_that_are_aligned_with_your_brand_personality\"><\/span><b>Choose the images that are aligned with your brand personality.<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about your brand\u2019s selected personality and choose images that reflect it. If you want to emphasize a love of the outdoors, use photos and video footages showing people using your product while trekking mountains, crossing rivers, or taking a plunge at sea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Consider_the_emotions_you_want_to_elicit\"><\/span><b>Consider the emotions you want to elicit.<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get clear about the emotions you want your customers to associate with your brand. If you want clients to feel good about themselves, prioritize this in your choice of visuals. For example, feature images or videos of individuals with different hairstyles, skin color, body size, or even those with disabilities who feel good about how they look and who they are now. If you want to emphasize feelings of home, family, and belonging, show family members of various ages celebrating, traveling, or bonding over a meal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage color psychology as well. For example, if you want to nurture feelings of security and integrity, you can play around with blue tones in your <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/how-web-design-impact-customer-experience\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web design<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and feature people wearing blue clothing as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Use_Fonts_That_Exude_Your_Brand_Personality\"><\/span><b>2.)

Taglines offer you a way to emphasize your value proposition and grab the attention of your target market segment. Take for instance the following taglines or slogans:<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nike: \u201cJust Do It\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M&amp;M: \u201cMelts in Your Mouth, Not in Your Hands\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ford: \u201cGo Further\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southwest Airlines: \u201cSomebody Else Up There Who Loves You\u201d and \u201cYou Are Now Free to Move About the Country\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These lines seem to have been embedded in customers\u2019 minds. And even if you\u2019ve never heard of some of these companies, their taglines make you curious enough to act&#8211;i.e., look them up, send a query, check out their products, or eventually buy from them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When coming up with authentic taglines for your brand, start by capturing what your company does in a few lines. Continue trimming it down until you come up with one sentence or phrase that clearly communicates your product benefits, one that\u2019s easy to remember and evokes the emotions you want your clients to feel.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Craft_a_Distinct_Brand_Logo\"><\/span><b>4.)

The imagery needs to draw out emotions or specific experiences in your viewers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Maximize_Social_Media_Videos_and_Posts_to_Display_Authenticity\"><\/span><b>5.)

However, showing a user the same ad too many times can harm the success of your PPC campaign and your brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent users from seeing an ad too many times, most of the major PPC advertising platforms allow the advertiser to apply a frequency cap. This tells the system not to show an advertisement to a user more than a set number of times.

Having a high-frequency rate can annoy your customers. Here are some reasons why you should apply a frequency cap to your PPC campaigns:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Maintain a positive brand image<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 If you annoy a user by showing them too many ads, then this is likely to give them a negative impression of your business. This could result in them being put off engaging with your business which will mean a reduction in profits for your business.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Optimize CTR<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 If a user sees your ad multiple times, then this is likely to bring your clickthrough rate down. The clickthrough rate of your ads is an essential factor in deciding your click prices. If users engage with your ads more, then will bring down your click prices and ultimately result in you being able to buy more clicks for your budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Put spend to good use<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; This can often be a problem when your audience list isn\u2019t large enough for your budget. In this case, the advertising platform may decide to show your ad to the same person multiple times. If you have a frequency cap set in place, your ad won\u2019t show the same person too many times.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Control the flow of ads to users<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; If you have ads in multiple ad groups (or ad sets depending on the advertising platform being used), then the same user can see an ad from each of your ad groups or ad sets. Having the ability to set a frequency cap means you can take measures to control how many times each user sees an ad from your business regardless of how many campaigns or ad groups are potentially targeting that user.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Also, Read &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/blog\/google-play-vs-app-store-where-should-you-launch-the-first-mobile-app\/\">Google Play VS App Store: Where Should You Launch The First Mobile App<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"\/blog\/ez-ranking-seo-vs-godaddy-seo\/\">EZ Ranking SEO Vs GoDaddy SEO \u2013 Which One Is Better<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_a_good_frequency_CAP\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a good frequency CAP?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exact frequency cap that you apply will depend on your actual campaign, the audience that you\u2019re targeting and your business niche. For example, users in the SaaS (software as a service) and digital marketing niches are a lot more aware of paid digital marketing practices. This means that you\u2019re a lot more likely to annoy these people by showing them ads too often.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of advertising platforms allow the user to specify that they don\u2019t want to see your ad anymore. If enough users do this, then you\u2019re likely to start to see a reduction in impressions on your ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10828 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/07123801\/good-frequency-CAP.png\" alt=\"good frequency CAP\" width=\"516\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/07123801\/good-frequency-CAP.png 516w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/07123801\/good-frequency-CAP-300x177.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a very general rule, I don\u2019t like to show an ad to the same user more than three times a day.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not sure on the frequency cap to apply to your PPC advertising campaigns, then A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pepper.agency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UK PPC agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you to make this decision for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_I_set_a_Frequency_cap\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I set a Frequency cap?<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you want to apply a frequency cap to your PPC campaigns, and you\u2019ve decided on the cap to apply, but how do you apply it in the advertising platform?

If you choose a campaign objective that doesn\u2019t allow you to set a frequency cap, then you can still try to control the frequency cap by setting a budget that is right for the audience size. Facebook will try to spend your daily budget by showing your ads to people in your audience list. This means that if you set a budget that is too large for your audience size, then Facebook will need to show the same person your ad more than once. If you reduce your budget, then there is a higher chance of each person not seeing the same ad twice.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Adroll\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adroll<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By default, Adroll\u2019s frequency capping is set to allow BidIQ (Adroll\u2019s artificial intelligence to decide how often to show ads to the same person. If you want to control the number of times that your ad is shown to a person, then you will need to switch BidIQ off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To set a frequency cap in Adroll, go to \u2018Campaign Settings\u2019 when creating a campaign and look for the \u2018Frequency Capping\u2019 option.

You don\u2019t want to ruin your brand by showing people ads too many times and annoying them. Therefore, frequency capping is a crucial factor to consider.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual frequency cap that you set will depend on your business niche, your audience and the quality of the content that you\u2019re showing to them. If the advertising platform that you\u2019re using does not offer a frequency capping option, then you still have a partial solution by selecting the right budget for your audience size.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By setting a frequency cap, you protect your brand and may also end up improving the clickthrough rate of your PPC advertising campaigns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Author Bio<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rashed started off doing SEO for over two years before finding his passion for PPC marketing.

Let&#8217;s first discuss the factors that influence the timing of publishing content on TikTok.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Target_audience\"><\/span>1. Target audience:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re targeting a global audience, then the best time to post on TikTok is during the evening and night-time in your target time zone. This is because most people are online during these hours. Moreover, the competition among videos is also lower during these times.

Content:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The type of content you&#8217;re posting also affects the best time to post on TikTok.

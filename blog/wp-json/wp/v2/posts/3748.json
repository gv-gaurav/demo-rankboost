It would be best to use solid firewalls, malware protection, and other security measures to keep hackers out of your site.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Not offering enough payment options<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Offering multiple payment options is essential for any eCommerce store.

Knowing your local, state, and federal tax obligations are essential so you don&#8217;t end up in hot water with the government! How to avoid this mistake? Make sure you have a qualified accountant who can help you sort out all the paperwork and ensure your business remains compliant.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Not Following All Necessary Regulations: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many eCommerce businesses fail because they aren&#8217;t aware of or follow all of the necessary regulations for online sales. Regulations vary from country to country and even between states. Hence, you must research what applies to you before you start selling. How to avoid this mistake? Consult with a lawyer specializing in e-commerce laws and regulations to ensure compliance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Not Having the Right Insurances:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your business needs to be protected, which means having the right insurance policies in place. Make sure you cover yourself against any accidents that might occur while running your e-commerce store. To avoid this blunder, talk to an experienced insurance broker who can advise you on the best coverage for your business model.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Not Keeping Accurate Records:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When it comes time for taxes, all your records must be up-to-date and accurate. This includes sales, expenses, inventory records, and more. So make sure you track and document everything related to your e-commerce store so that it can all be easily accessed when needed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Not Staying Up to Date on Changes:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Things are constantly changing in the e-commerce world, so it&#8217;s crucial to stay up-to-date with any new regulations or developments that may affect how you operate your business. That&#8217;s why you should follow industry news sources and regularly review all relevant laws and regulations so you know what always applies to you. Taking the time to understand these topics will help ensure your business stays compliant and successful!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Shipping_Costs\"><\/span><b>8.

If you can do so, offering free delivery is one way to increase your customer satisfaction and loyalty levels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Ignoring International Customers:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Depending on the size of your business, it can be easy to forget about new opportunities for growth overseas. Ensure you include reasonable international shipping costs in your pricing structure if you tap into these markets.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Forgetting About Refunds: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s not uncommon for customers to return their purchases or demand an exchange if something goes wrong with their order. Make sure you have clear policies regarding returns and refunds before your customers start making purchases.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Failing to Consider Shipping Providers: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different shipping companies offer different services and rates, so it&#8217;s important to research which providers will give you the best deal for your business. You can negotiate better prices with certain carriers if you&#8217;re a frequent customer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Not Having Flexible Shipping Options: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers frequently prefer selecting their preferred delivery method during checkout. Make sure you provide them with various payment and shipping options tailored to their needs. This way, they can choose what works best for them without feeling stuck with an inconvenient solution. Doing this will help create a positive impression on your business.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><b>Conclusion<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running an e-commerce store isn\u2019t a piece of cake \u2013 but we promise it can be one delicious slice (pun totally intended).

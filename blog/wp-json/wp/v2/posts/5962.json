For example, if you do not want your website to be a very fancy one, you can choose a simple theme. It has just the basics needed. Your work on the website and the tools designed on your own will be the important part of the website. On the other hand, if you have a comparatively more pragmatic approach you can apply a theme which is more developer-centric. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_theme_should_match_your_content\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>The theme should match your content<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The content is ultimately what the readers will be interested in. So your WordPress starter theme should match your content. It is often the case the people try to make the content according to a theme that they find appealing. This approach is wrong. In the process, you might end up using a theme that requires more money than your budget and is also not fit enough. So the ideal way is to think whether that particular theme is favorable to your content. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Define_Budget\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Define Budget<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Your budget is another greater constraint that would decide your theme choice. If you are not willing to spend much on the theme and concentrate on the other factors, your choice of theme will be of a particular type. You can make such a choice if you are confident that the other factors will be adequate for making your website design friendly. In another case, you can think that your theme is no less important and will increase your website appeal. Then go for a comparatively developed starter theme. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Flexible_is_The_Theme\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>How Flexible is The Theme<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The flexibility of your theme is also an important factor. If you want a theme on which you can make changes in the future, then go for a WordPress theme that suits your purpose. That will obviously have a different set of characteristics altogether. You will be able to mold such a theme depending upon your requirements of the design. There are custom types of posts in those themes. On the other hand, there are themes that are completely static and also ready-to-use. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Speed_of_your_theme\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>The Speed of your theme<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The speed of the website is also a constraint. There are some starter themes that will offer you excellent speed. But they have the minimum or almost zero stylization. These themes are referred to as blank slate themes. They require you to be adept in certain system software such as CSS and other specialized software systems. There are certain website builders who require much greater speed than others. In that case, choosing these kinds of websites is permissible. Also, you must note again that such themes come with no or minimum stylization. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4 align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Go_ahead_and_build_your_Website\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><b>Go ahead and build your Website<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">These are the few essentials that you must keep in mind while choosing this theme. Starter themes are very beneficial to those who are beginners in WordPress as they come with ready to use features. But still, among the thousands of starter themes available, it becomes difficult to choose the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/wordpress-development-company.html\">WordPress Website Development<\/a> Theme. So it is these guidelines that will help you in such a situation. Go ahead and build your website according to these guidelines. You are sure to succeed.a<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">For instance, a more complex content having a number of subdivisions may require a more developed starter theme.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wondering how you will select a WordPress starter theme for your business?

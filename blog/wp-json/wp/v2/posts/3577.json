Well, not all the attention is in a good way. There is also a lot of myth that runs parallel to this industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though this might look like an easy task to set up the SEO Company &amp; run it. The insiders will agree to me that it\u2019s not as easy as it looks. There are so many questions that need answers, myths to clear, and also get blamed for mistakes that other novices or self-proclaimed experts make.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let\u2019s talk about the top 5 common misconceptions that we being part of the SEO Industry face:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1 &#8211; SEO Is More Than Software:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some believe SEO is simply about using software to create links, fix technical website details, and track improvements. In reality, SEO is a combination of science and art. While there are technical aspects like meta tags and H1 tags, the content you create is not automated by software.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2 &#8211; SEO Isn&#8217;t Cheap:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&#8217;s considered &#8220;cheap&#8221; varies from person to person. Quality SEO isn&#8217;t as inexpensive as $50 a month. If you want experienced professionals working on your website, be prepared to pay a reasonable fee.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3 &#8211; SEO Is Different from Social:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SEO and social media serve distinct purposes. SEO focuses on search engines and website promotion, while social media is about engaging with your audience. Make sure to clarify what services are included when working with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-company-india.html\">SEO agency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4 &#8211; SEO Is About Relevant Rankings:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Achieving top-page rankings is a common goal, but it&#8217;s crucial to target the right keywords. Being on the first page for irrelevant terms won&#8217;t bring in business. A reliable company will guide you on the right keywords for your business, leading to more traffic and higher conversions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5 &#8211; SEO Is Ongoing, Not One-Time:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every other day, we get asked if SEO is a one-time thing. I am sorry but the answer is NO. Why? SEO is an ongoing thing. It is definitely advised to continue efforts irrespective you are on the top page because ongoing efforts will help the business retain positions and not to forget, focus on new platforms that the digital world has to offer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In short, SEO is more complex than just using software, it&#8217;s not super cheap, it&#8217;s different from social media, it&#8217;s about targeting the right keywords, and it&#8217;s an ongoing process, not a one-time thing. Understanding these facts will help you use SEO more effectively.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, these are just a few of the common misconceptions that the SEO industry faces. I will be happy to hear your thoughts on the same.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SEO companies have managed to earn quite an attention in the last few years.

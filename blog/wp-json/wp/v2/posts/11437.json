Offer What You Can Do<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing that you have to do is to offer services or products that you can provide. If you are not capable of doing something then never offer it to the client. You must be telling them that you cannot provide that particular service. This is one of the biggest mistakes that new agencies or freelancers make most of the time. They offer services to the clients that they actually cannot do.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/international-seo\/\">International SEO Guide: A Complete Checklist<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Assign_Separate_Resources\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#2.

All of our clients provide us with feedback. If you don&#8217;t take their feedback seriously, then you are missing something big to impress your big client. But how can you take feedback seriously? You must be making changes to your services according to the client\u2019s previous feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Communicate_Properly\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#4.

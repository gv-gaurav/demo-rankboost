What are the biggest changes with GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Migrating to Google Analytics 4 (GA4) promises upgraded features and capabilities, such as faster performance, improved visualizations, and a more robust data-collection and structure model. With this new format, companies will better understand their customers&#8217; user journeys and how they interact with their websites.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each user interaction, such as page views, clicks, and conversions, is tracked as its event, enabling a more detailed analysis of customer behaviour. By starting the migration process now, businesses can leverage GA4&#8217;s unique features, gain a clearer understanding of their customers, and deliver better insights to stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q2. What are the disadvantages of GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Google Analytics 4 brings an updated reporting and measurement protocol that is largely unfamiliar to many marketers. It can make navigating the platform difficult. Furthermore, transferring data from Universal Analytics is challenging, which GA4 does not make more accessible.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Compounding this difficulty, the new user interface can disorientate marketers using Universal Analytics, and creating custom dimensions is less convenient than before. Moreover, it can be challenging for users to comprehend the metrics that measure conversions or other success elements. Consequently, a thorough migration plan must be crafted to transition to GA4.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q3. Why are there no views on GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the default version of Google Analytics and does not have the concept of views as was the case with Universal Analytics. Therefore, when you set up a new GA4 property, you no longer need to worry about creating views since it no longer exists in this version.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">GA4 utilizes data streams from websites, iOS, and Android apps with filters applied at the property level to customize the single reporting view. Filters to exclude internal traffic are set up directly to the data streams and then feed into the single view.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q4. Can you have multiple views in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can have up to 30 conversions configured in a GA4 property (or up to 50 for a 360 property) in addition to the four automatically tracked conversion events. However, if you have more than 30 goals across all the views in a Universal Analytics property, it&#8217;s best to rethink your measuring approach.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Opt only to track the most critical events on your website or app; you can use the features present in GA4, such as audiences and comparisons, to view similar goals in multiple views within the same Universal Analytics property.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q5. How many parameters can you have in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Parameters are additional pieces of data that give further context to Google Analytics events. It is critical to understanding user interactions with your website. GA4 event parameters vary in comparison to Universal Analytics.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are four different categories of GA4 events. It includes automatically collected events and enhanced measurement events, recommended events and custom events. Each event contains at least five parameters, while custom and recommended events may require more. All of these parameters are vital to understanding user interaction with your website.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q6. How many properties can you have in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Properties are the containers that store the data collected from an app, website, or combination. With a Google Analytics 4 Property, you can track up to 2,000 separate pieces of data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This property type helps track a single game across platforms like Android and iOS. Analytics 360 customers can also create additional types of properties, such as sub properties, which are derived from another property, and roll-up properties, which pull data from multiple other properties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q7. How many segments can we create in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Segments in GA4 can be a powerful tool for unlocking actionable insights from your data. Rather than working with overall metrics, segments allow you to focus on a specific subset of your data, such as a particular device type or geographic region, and draw more detailed conclusions about performance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Segments differ from filters limited to the current report or exploration but cannot be used in other analyses. By comparing segmented data, you can gain valuable insight into how different viewers are engaging, which can drive more intelligent decisions about your business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q8. How many filters are in GA4?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The filters applied in Google Analytics 4 are relatively stricter. Instead of being able to filter by URL string as before, the event-based model in GA4 has a much simpler approach and only allows for traffic from internal sources by IP address. Additionally, IP ranges indicate using CIDR notation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While removing the filters from the property configuration can still be present in the Explorer reports provided in GA4. This shift epitomizes the new data model of GA4, which is flat, simplistic, and flexible while ensuring data collects in a way that respects user privacy without needing third-party cookies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q9. What is the maximum payload size for GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We need to know the differences between events, event parameters and user properties to understand the applicable limits. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) event parameters are limited to 100 characters. In contrast, Google Analytics Universal (GAU) allows up to 150 bytes and supports up to 150 letters\u2014although the total hit payload limit is still 8192 bytes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, specific event names are reserved for exceptional cases such as account creation, login, content sharing, and eCommerce and game-specific events. All limits and rules must be followed to ensure successful cross-platform collection with consistent data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q10. How many custom events are there in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">GA4 has four different event types that allow you to track user actions on your website: automatically tracked events, enhanced event measurements, recommended events, and custom events. Automatically tracked events record the same information across all websites, such as the language setting of the visitor&#8217;s browser.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enhanced event measurements allow you to configure GA4 to collect data for specific events. Recommended events benefit most sites but must be configured to track them. Finally, custom events will enable you to track user actions specific to your website. All of these events will appear in the report of the event.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q11. How do you create a custom dimension in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Custom dimensions and custom metrics are user-defined data points that enable the tracking of website activity beyond what Analytics automatically records. They help capture data from custom event parameters or user properties that may be unavailable otherwise and help answer questions specific to each business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To set up custom dimensions and metrics, the user must first set up the data point in their property and then modify their tracking code. These data points are distinct from the default dimensions and metrics in an Analytics account and require the user to have the Editor role in creating or editing them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Q12. What are user properties in GA4?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">User properties identify characteristics in a group of your users, such as their language or location. Additionally, you can create custom user-scoped dimensions, which allow you to keep track of the data on user properties collected.

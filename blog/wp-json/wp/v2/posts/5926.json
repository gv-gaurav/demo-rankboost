If you are acquainted with projects like Jasmine, Mocha and Q-unit, then using this will be a piece of cake. This is very user-friendly and there are no complications at all.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Angular uses HTML as a template: <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">If you have sufficient experience in Hojan or Mustache; then you will have no difficulty in understanding the syntax that comes with the templating engine of Angular as it consists of only HTML. The templates are then passed on to the compiler in Angular where they are reused, executed and extended. This is significant as you will now have DOM components instead of just strings.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Enhance HTML<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">: With Angular, you can now use HTML in a similar fashion like XML and this will open up doors to explore endless possibilities regarding attributes and tags. All of this can be done through the HTML compiler and by using directives to initiate behaviors based on the new syntax that is created by you.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Dependency Injection and Binding of data: <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">Communication to UI within the pattern of MVVM is automatic whenever there is a change. This completely does away with the requirements for class declarations, getters and wrappers. Angular JS will take on all these aspects so you can put out your data using Javascript Primitives. Everything happens through an automated process you can request for dependencies in the service functions within AngularJS.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>MVVM saves the day: <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">Models communicate with the ViewModel which monitor changes made to Models. All of this is then rendered and delivered by Views, which again is HTML that shows your code. The views are routed by utilizing $route provider, all of this can organize and deep link all your controllers and views converting them to URLs that can be navigated easily. AngularJS provides the best controllers which control and initialize the $scope object.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>Rest Easy: <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">The restful actions have become a standard medium of communication between the client and the server. With a little bit of Javascript, you may communicate very easily with the server and acquire data that is needed for you to interact with web pages. Angular JS converts this to a simple object that is Javascript oriented.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\"><b>User-friendly interface: <\/b><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">The interface used by AngularJS is very user-friendly and is based on HTML which facilitates smooth operation.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-IN\">So you see that using AngularJS is not at all difficult, in fact, there are a plethora of things that you can achieve with it.

By deleting all-important search rankings from a page. One day your website could be highly rated by a lot of keywords across Google&#8217;s first list. The next day your website can not even rate with advertised keys after Google calculates the penalty (like your business name).

If you want to trick Google by treating your audiences with bogus and spammy content, we recommend changing your direction, adopting a more normal SEO path and concentrating on content marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two most significant algorithms have been updated: Penguin and Panda. Penguin fines are aimed at websites using the methods of black hat construction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We won&#8217;t speak about the Penguin or Panda or PageRank information very much because their past and details aren&#8217;t that relevant.

With their previously mentioned Panda update, Google first explored the problem of bad content. Thin content is classified as pages or shallow pages of low quality, by Google. Content scraped from another website is content republished for your own sake and without extra value.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_fix_it-2\"><\/span><b>How to fix it<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best thing you can do to remove or boost the pages involved is to fix a Thin Content manual operation.

Determine thin contents by on-site metrics such as bounce rate and time. Remove or upgrade the pages in question. Ensure 410 or redirect if you delete the page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon addressing the limited material on your pages, ask Google for re-examination using the Search Console tool for re-examination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read:<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/international-seo\/\"> International SEO Guide: A Complete Checklist<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Keyword_Stuffing\"><\/span><b>3. Keyword Stuffing<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword\u00a0stuffing was one of the original &#8220;techniques&#8221; for SEOs but it\u2019s not relevant now. This is mainly where a website fills a web page with keywords that add little meaning to a website. If you&#8217;ve ever seen a site in the footer, that&#8217;s keyword stuffing. Believe it or believe it or not, it succeeded. But Google soon caught up with this spammy trick, which was not successful for more than a decade.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_fix_it-3\"><\/span><b>How to fix it<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is only one tried and true approach if you want to rank for a target keyword: Have the best available website for that keyword. If you&#8217;re going to rate on the Mississippi side for &#8220;The best Turkey stuffing recipe&#8221; (search volume: 0), better supply this side of the Mississippi with the best damn turkey stuffing recipe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest way to get rid of all these spammy keywords is to remove all the stuffed keywords and write original and value-adding content on your site. Remove all the stuffed and spammy keywords from your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_does_a_website_impact_Google_Penalties\"><\/span><b>How does a website impact Google Penalties?<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search fines by Google may have a serious effect on organic traffic on a website.

Once you fix it, you can resolve the issue in the Google Search Console and Google will re-crawl the website. And, once you fix the problem, Google will recover all the losses in terms of rankings or traffic. In a few days or a week, you will notice that the traffic has regained and you are getting more visitors to your site.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The penalties of Google&#8217;s search engine were created to deter websites from committing &#8216;disappointment or exploitation.&#8217; Why is this discouraged by Google?

This also means that AI or artificial intelligence has started to change and evolve at the same time, which led to the creation of chatbots.

It is software that uses AI to simulate a conversation that might be had with another human being. This means that a chatbot is software that interacts with the users that land on your site using automation and acting as if they were a real person or a customer service agent. This program can process all of the natural languages that might be used and can maintain a conversation that is coherent with the user through chat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allows you to create a chatbot that you can use on your website that can answer all of the questions that they might have. The robot can analyze as well as understand the messages from the library in the question and answer section. You have to input the data for the chatbot to be able to relay it, but once you do this, then they can answer the questions that are there. This is perfect for a company that is looking for an easy way for the customers to get the answers that they need without hiring another employee.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Real-Time_Customer_Support\"><\/span><b>Real-Time Customer Support<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main ways that chatbots have had an impact on digital marketing in the last few years is by allowing real-time customer support. They can handle any customer service questions that come up and you don\u2019t have to hire any extra personnel on board to handle it. You can automate as well as manage all of the activities for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2020\/07\/02\/how-to-use-chatbots-to-improve-customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">customer support by using the chatbot<\/a>. There are plenty of things that the chatbot can do to help you when it comes to digital marketing like soliciting feedback from users, offering discounts on products, answering questions about products that are out of stock and much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9984 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122036\/real-time-Customer-Support.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122036\/real-time-Customer-Support.png 432w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122036\/real-time-Customer-Support-300x194.png 300w\" alt=\"Real Time Customer Support\" width=\"432\" height=\"279\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Taking_Orders\"><\/span><b>Taking Orders<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chatbot would also be able to help you when it comes to taking any orders for your products or services. They are efficient at this and they can not only take the orders, but they can also process the payment and arrange the necessary supplies. This is a good way to ensure that the orders that your customers are placing are done properly and that there are no mistakes made since the robot is incapable of any errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Aids_in_Promotion_and_Sales\"><\/span><b>Aids in Promotion and Sales<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chatbot can easily replicate various behaviors that are natural to any human being and at the same time they can offer better support for online marketing. It will put to use some of the rules that are predefined that will allow them to cleverly respond to the inquiries that the consumer is making. It can also help the customer when it comes to locating any product that they might need and offering them anything else that could work along with that. You should always make sure that you are thinking of the chatbot as the first line of defense and leave the harder questions to the actual customer support agents. This would allow for you to better manage your employees and their workload without the customer support suffering.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Keeping_Customer_Data_Straight\"><\/span><b>Keeping Customer Data Straight<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good thing about the chatbot is that while they are talking with the customer they will be able to keep all of the data regarding that individual straight. They would be able to remember the items that the customer purchased the last time and offer suggestions for what they might enjoy this time or even if they need the order placed again. This is one of the best ways to keep your data straight and for the customer to get the support they need without worrying about your agents becoming exhausted or confused.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Customer_Insights\"><\/span><b>Customer Insights<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing that the chatbot can do these days is asking the customers straight questions without them being offended. There are plenty of questions that they can ask, including where they live, what is their dream vacation and much more. This is the best way to get the information that is needed so that you can look back at it later to personalize the experience of the user when they return to the site without having to put too much effort into this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9985\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122040\/Chatbot-Stats.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1580px) 100vw, 1580px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122040\/Chatbot-Stats.jpg 1580w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122040\/Chatbot-Stats-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122040\/Chatbot-Stats-768x402.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/07122040\/Chatbot-Stats-1024x537.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"Customer Insights\" width=\"1580\" height=\"828\" \/><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Efficiency\"><\/span><b>Efficiency<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great way that chatbots have been helping when it comes to digital marketing is by making it much more efficient. If you are letting them do the majority of the simple work like answering questions and getting feedback from the consumer, then your actual agents can deal with the tougher work. This means that they can deal with the major problems rather than spending their time answering questions and other work that the robot could be doing for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go ahead and ensure that you are aware of just what the chatbot does and the various impacts that it has had on the digital marketing industry. It has helped all businesses become much more efficient since they can take over some of the simple tasks and the harder tasks can be done by actual employees. They are also great for ensuring that all orders are placed properly and that all insights are gleaned from the consumer as possible. There are so many reasons that using a chatbot is the right choice for all businesses, especially those that do business online.

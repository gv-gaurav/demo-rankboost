Create articles on the most-searched industry statistics:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Research the most-searched topics and industry statistics in your niche, then create an article that has a unique take on them. These types of articles can be highly effective for SEO as they are often shared by other websites and publishers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make sure to include keywords relevant to your target audience in the article title, headings, and content. This will help improve the visibility of your article on search engine results pages (SERPs). The majority of people prefer reading articles that are written in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner. So make sure to avoid using overly technical language and break down complex concepts.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"iii_Gain_top_positions_by_ranking_on_low-competition_phrases\"><\/span>(iii). Gain top positions by ranking on low-competition phrases:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to rank in top positions of SERPs, you need to focus your SEO efforts on low-competition phrases. Try to identify keywords that are not overly competitive but still have high search volumes. These types of terms are often referred to as &#8220;long tail keywords&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Optimizing for these long-tail keywords will help improve your rankings and boost your website&#8217;s visibility on SERPs.

Do podcast interviews on high DA websites:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Podcasts are one of the most popular content formats right now and they can be very effective for SEO. Reach out to high-DA websites in your niche and request to be a guest on their podcast. This will help you build relationships with industry influencers, as well as get backlinks from authoritative domains.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make sure to prepare for the interview by researching the topics that are likely to be discussed. This will give you the best chance of creating an engaging and informative podcast episode that can be shared across multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"v_Promote_your_top_linkable_content_with_targeted_ads\"><\/span>(v).

Use estimated traffic potential than single-phrase search volume:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rather than just focusing on the single phrase search volume for individual keywords, you should also consider the estimated traffic potential of keyword combinations. This is a great way to identify high-value keywords that are likely to drive more organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make it easier, single-phrase keyword volume means the total search volume for any given keyword. Estimated traffic potential, on the other hand, is the estimated amount of organic traffic that can be generated by leveraging a combination of related terms. The more you focus on accurate keyword research, the better your chances of creating effective SEO strategies that deliver results in 2024.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ii_Search_for_top-ranking_URLs_with_zero_backlinks\"><\/span>(ii). Search for top-ranking URLs with zero backlinks:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another great way to identify high-value keywords is to look for top-ranking URLs with zero backlinks. This means that the page ranks on SERPs despite not having any external backlinks pointing toward it. You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/top-paid-seo-tools\/\">SEO tools<\/a> such as Ahrefs or SEMrush to find these pages and uncover their associated keyword phrases.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you analyze the pages and understand the phrases they\u2019re ranking for, you can use these terms to optimize your content. This is a great way to improve your rankings and get more organic traffic from SERPs. This process might take time to find such URLs but once you do, you\u2019ll be able to create effective content using them that will rank quickly.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"iii_Dont_rank_on_SERPs_that_have_a_local_pack_they_have_the_lowest_organic_CTR\"><\/span>(iii). Don&#8217;t rank on SERPs that have a local pack (they have the lowest organic CTR):<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When creating your SEO strategy, it\u2019s important to consider the SERP features that are likely to have an impact on your rankings. One of the most common SERP features today is the local pack, which displays a list of local businesses related to a specific search query.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These listings have very low organic CTR so it\u2019s best to avoid ranking for these types of SERPs. Instead, focus on optimizing your content for keywords that are likely to display a carousel or featured snippet instead. This will help you get more organic traffic and help you create effective SEO strategies that deliver results in 2024.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"iv_Identify_keyword_clusters_and_build_content_around_them\"><\/span>(iv). Identify keyword clusters and build content around them:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/guide-on-keyword-clustering\/\">Keyword clusters<\/a> are related phrases that can be used to create more comprehensive topics. When you identify these clusters, you can use them to build content that is optimized for multiple related phrases. This will improve your chances of ranking on SERPs and increase the amount of organic traffic you\u2019re able to generate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To identify keyword clusters, use tools such as Ahrefs or Moz to find related terms for any given keyword phrase. This will help you create comprehensive topics that are optimized for multiple related phrases. When building content around these clusters, make sure to include all relevant terms in the content so that it can rank for multiple phrases. This is one of the best ways to create effective SEO strategies that deliver results in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Content_Creation_Strategies\"><\/span>3.

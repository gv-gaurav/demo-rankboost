Core update is broad, exhaustive and involves tweaking the main algorithm.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Officially Google says that nothing is required to be done by website owners to fix their sites.<\/li>\n<li>It is not targeted at any defined niches and is not only about the quality of the site.<\/li>\n<li>The results have just begun to show now.<\/li>\n<li>For sites that are beginning to rank low, there might not be anything that they can do to fix it. Rather they need to research on the relevance of the content of the site as the reason behind the low ranking.<\/li>\n<li>What is known is that Google has changed the weight age of some of the important ranking factors as it has published that \u2013 the value of keywords on H1 tags have been increased by 2%; the HTTPS values have been increased by 8%; the value of the keyword in a title tag has been decreased by 9%; the D value in PageRank calculation has been changed from 0.85 to 0.70; and the traditional method of retrieving logged-in users have been changed from TF-PDF method to TF-iDUF method.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Some noticeable results that have started to show post the update:-<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>While some users reported positive growth in traffic, there were others who have been registering growth for months in the pre-core update days but their ranks dropped considerably in the days after the update.<\/li>\n<li>From automotive, finance, medical to health niches, many have been witnessing plumage in their traffic.<\/li>\n<li>Some have reported that while the traffic on their desktop site surged, the mobile traffic had no changes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the worst hit by this core update was the DailyMail.com that had the highest English news reading traffic globally till sometime back.

Over the years, the company has made many notable additions and amendments in its core algorithm. In July 2018, it did announce the Google Mobile Speed Update but changes in core algorithms have always been publicized only after roll-out. It is however, for the first time in June 2019 that the company actually announced a roll-out in advance. This sets a new precedent for the company which has been doing core updates previously too but mostly behind the scene.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact the core update before this was in March 2019. The reason why Google decided to pre-announce this time is because the company wanted to proactively share information about updates with website owners and SEOs, something that the community has been asking for quite some time now. Even though officially the company says that there is nothing momentous or big about the recent update and it\u2019s just some core updates, vis-\u00e0-vis previous updates, they wanted to keep the community informed before the actual roll-out so that no one is left \u2018scratching their heads\u2019 after the release of the update.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Tomorrow, we are releasing a broad core algorithm update, as we do several times per year. It is called the June 2019 Core Update. Our guidance about such updates remains as we\u2019ve covered before.

Ensure good quality content. Use plagiarism-free content on your site. Fresh and authentic content have lesser chances of being affected by Google updates.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Make your website appealing and attractive but not a copy of any other existing site. Use of pictures, audios and videos help in enhancing the look as well visitor experience to the site. Today Google places a great amount of value on contents that live upto user intent and needs \u2013 hence ensure the same.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. A robust, clean and authentic web architecture and build-up is a must to keep the bounce rate under control. The Google algorithm tends to ignore sites with higher bounce rates.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Having mobile compatible sites that load faster helps beat any kind of algorithm updates of Google.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Keep the right balance between bombarding the user with advertisements when he visits your site and going in for selective advertising? Let advertising be subtle and keep it under check on the site.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. At all costs ensure that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services.html\">SEO Services Expert<\/a> is hired for the task. It is important to keep meeting the guidelines that Google keeps issuing from time to time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7. Maintain the quality of the site and keep improving even if you are at the top rank.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use the right tool to check your site\u2019s rank \u2013 most ranking tools give you the updated rank for the day, once a day. This way you can keep a check on the site ranking and take immediate action. The tools come with relevant alerts and triggers that inform you instantly of a change that takes place.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_recover_if_your_rankings_Traffic_Dropped_after_a_Google_Update\"><\/span><strong>How to recover if your rankings &amp; Traffic Dropped after a Google Update?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer to this question lies in first finding out the true reason behind the ranking drop.

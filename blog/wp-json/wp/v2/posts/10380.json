But today, nearly eight years later, almost every one in every six Americans owns a smart speaker. <a href=\"https:\/\/econsultancy.com\/the-future-of-voice-search-2020-and-beyond\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Researchers also predict<\/a> that more than 100 million Smartphone users will be using voice assistants by 2020<\/p>\n<p>Voice-based interfaces are progressing at an exponential rate in various marketing sectors, and brands like Google and Amazon are continuing to fuel this trend. In 2016, Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed that more than 20% of the total search queries were being placed via voice search. From healthcare to banking, the marketers are competing to introduce their own voice technology integrations to meet the changing user demands.<\/p>\n<p>So, how is this new medium taking off? How does it differ from the earlier keyboard searches? What are the challenges it poses for the local businesses (who will now be competing in yet another platform)? Today, we are going to delve into the root of this fast-evolving technology to find answers to all these questions.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get right into it without any further ado:<\/p>\n<div

class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As the search engines have evolved over the years, their ability to comprehend language patterns and intent behind user queries have improved. It was Google\u2019s 2013 Hummingbird update that essentially paved the way for this evolution (as the algorithm allowed Google\u2019s search engine to understand the queries in a much better manner.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and several other digital assistants are now voice search-enabled and are growing smarter and sharper with every interaction. The AI technology, (that powers voice search) is also evolving at a massive rate. The AI already understands the context of a search along with user intent. It tracks information like previous search queries, past user behavior, and multiple-step queries to better anticipate the search needs. Voice search technology can also be advantageous in the educational field. Students who are weak at spellings can simply use the voice search feature to search the internet for their requirements. They use this technology in completing their assignment. Also, words provide a lot more information to the AI\u2019s voice recognition technology (as compared to typed search queries). Generally, a text query typically consists of two to three words, but a spoken query often exceeds that word limit, which makes the speech recognition technology sharper and more user-friendly with every passing minute.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Voice_Search_Affects_Search_Engine_Optimization\"><\/span>How Voice Search Affects Search Engine Optimization<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The advent of <a href=\"\/blog\/guide-to-optimization-of-voice-search\/\">voice search<\/a> has affected the online SEO industry to a great extent. It has become essential for the enterprises and local businesses to incorporate voice search technology into their marketing ventures to survive in this competitive business world. But why is it so important to rank number1 in your voice search engines? Primarily the reason is, the virtual assistants rarely present two answers more often than not. This means being on number 1 pages of search results is not enough anymore. The competition becomes more cutthroat and brings much more pressure on the local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s now get into the heart of the matter and discuss the practical implications of this emerging trend of voice search.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10382 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/07122711\/Google-Assistant-The-Verge.jpg\" alt=\"Impact of Voice Search\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/07122711\/Google-Assistant-The-Verge.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/07122711\/Google-Assistant-The-Verge-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/07122711\/Google-Assistant-The-Verge-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/07122711\/Google-Assistant-The-Verge-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Attaining_position_zero_will_become_challenging\"><\/span>Attaining position zero will become challenging<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Research has shown that voice search tends to favor the results on featured snippets (popularly known as position zero, i.e. the summary of the answers to a user\u2019s query that is displayed on the very top of Google\u2019s search results.) And these topmost search results drive an incredible amount of traffic. The evolution of text-to-speech has made it essential for marketers to optimize their online content in order to attain position zero and provide the users (who are searching by voice) with a better experience.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Molding_the_website_content_for_FAQs_will_be_essential\"><\/span>Molding the website content for FAQs will be essential<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A huge part of today\u2019s search queries involves question-based searches. Terms starting with \u2018what is\u2026\u2019 \u2018how to\u2026\u2019 and \u2018why do\u2026.\u2019, have suddenly grown in popularity, especially in the voice search arena. And this has led to Google becoming the most extensive resource for FAQ answers (for every possible question under the sun). And voice recognition AI can sift through the piles of data available on Google, to find the ideal customers and clients.<\/p>\n<p>So, in order to rank the highest in the snippets, the B2B and B2C marketers will need to restructure their contents to make sure it answers the questions the potential customers will be asking.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Predicting_a_customers_journey_will_become_much_easier\"><\/span>Predicting a customer\u2019s journey will become much easier<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Currently, most of the digital marketing strategies are based on a significant amount of \u2018guesswork\u2019. Marketers constantly go on adjusting, testing and experimenting with their strategies to ensure more profit. But with the promising development of these accurate analytical tools, quite soon, digital marketing professionals will be able to predict the buyer\u2019s journey in a much better way and optimize their online content accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>An extensive study on the voice search queries will help the marketers understand the various types of queries that surface the featured snippets. It will, in turn, let them figure out the specific resources to provide the best answers to the most commonly featured snippets to get promoted to position zero.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Smart_Tips_To_Improve_Your_Voice_Search_SEO\"><\/span>5 Smart Tips To Improve Your Voice Search SEO<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The advancement of voice recognition is a giant leap forward in ensuring that queries are answered appropriately and quickly.

Here\u2019s one piece of advice; while trying to optimize your site for voice search, place yourself in the consumers\u2019 shoes and think of the possible questions a consumer is likely to ask. You can also prepare questionnaires and surveys to collect the information.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are an ice-cream manufacturer, your consumers will most likely ask questions like, \u201cWhich is the best ice-cream shop near my location\u201d or perhaps a diabetic person might inquire, \u201cIs there any ice-cream shop near me that makes sugar-free ice cream?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To make sure your shop is featured at the very top of the search engine, try to incorporate sentences like \u201cWe prepare the most delicious and tasty ice-cream near you\u201d or \u201cSatisfy your sweet tooth even if your diabetic, get sugar-free ice-creams that melt in your mouth\u201d in your content.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Include_specific_locations_for_local_SEO\"><\/span>Include specific locations for local SEO<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>People often include phrases such as <a href=\"\/blog\/5-local-seo-experts-share-voice-search-and-near-me-predictions\/\">\u2018near me\u2019 and \u2018around me\u2019 during voice search<\/a>. For example, if you are a restaurant owner based in California, make sure you include keywords like Los Angles, San Francisco as well as names of nearby towns and cities to your site. Whenever people use voice search to locate restaurants near Los Angles, your business will have a higher chance of showing up as a result. Also, a location-specific search has a stronger chance of acquiring new business, so it will be worth including locations whenever possible.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Use_structured_data_to_help_Google\"><\/span>Use structured data to help Google<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Structured data will help Google find the relevant information on your page.

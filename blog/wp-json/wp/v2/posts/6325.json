There is a possibility of generating hundreds of links within a short period but those backlinks are spammy and of inferior quality. Therefore it has to be kept in mind that quality shall always rule over quantity. A backlink that hails from an authorized website will be far more advantageous to hundreds of these links from the spam sites. You must also avoid building too many links of low quality on your site.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Ignoring_tags\"><\/span><strong>2. Ignoring tags<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The most important thing to realize is that search engine optimization is directly related to some of the tags of HTML. This tag that bears the title is beneficial for the visitors on the site and the search engines. Keeping this in mind you have to set a balance between readability and keywords. Many site owners neglect and avoid the title tags, and there can be a no bigger mistake than this. Therefore it is mandatory to make sure that there is a primary keyword that must be placed in the title and the title should be well readable.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Correcting_texts_and_avoiding_links\"><\/span><strong>3. Correcting texts and avoiding links<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The links need to be entirely pertinent, and this holds true in case outbound and inbound links. The links offer rare opportunities for using phrases and keywords effectively. Many of you only move ahead by using phrases like \u201cclick here\u201d, but this wastes the opportunity. After building a link, it is therefore essential to complete the job with an appropriate anchor text. Another significant error that is done by most of you is placing outbound links to some other website without realizing there are chances of your site getting disappeared. This further leads to a broken link on your site. Your site\u2019s reputation is at stake because of numerous broken links.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Stuffing_keywords\"><\/span><strong>4. Stuffing keywords<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When it comes down to maintaining your presence on the internet, it is highly essential to have appropriate keywords. These keywords are nothing but the keys for your website to be found amongst the billion searches conducted every day. Nevertheless, many site owners around the world overuse and populate the web page or the content with only keywords. When you do that to secure maximum ranks, you make the most expensive mistake. Whenever the keyword density tends to be higher, all the search engines recognize it within no time. Therefore rather than overstuffing contents with keywords, it is essential to place them accurately.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Analyse_well\"><\/span><strong>5.

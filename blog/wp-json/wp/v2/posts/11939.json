You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/top-10-seo-tools-that-every-webmaster-must-use\/\">use an SEO tool<\/a> to run competitive analysis and check the keywords on which your competitors&#8217; websites are ranking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the pages, the content, and blog posts to know how they have managed to get the keyword ranked on top positions. While doing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/how-to-do-keywords-analysis-research\/\">keyword research<\/a>, try to find such keywords that have higher search volume with lower competition. The benefit of such keywords is that your website can easily rank on them and it will start bringing organic traffic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Websites_architecture_and_navigation\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website&#8217;s architecture and navigation<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Website architecture that leads to a good user experience is a major ranking factor and search engines pay great attention. The website&#8217;s architecture falls in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/core-web-vital-the-next-big-things-in-seo\/\">Core Web Vitals<\/a> and it has to be seamless.

While developing the website, make sure the users can easily reach a product or service that they are searching for on your website.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The navigation needs to be as fast and seamless as possible. Focus on creating an accessible menu, create easy-to-understand categories, and maintain the right page hierarchy. If you can link all the important pages with the home page, you can easily pass on the SEO juice to other pages. Make sure to implement structured data on your website to make it easier for search engines to index websites faster.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"On-page_SEO_practices\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-page SEO practices<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-page SEO is broad and when you are starting out, you can focus on the main things that will bring the highest results.

The meta tags include creating SEO-friendly titles, meta descriptions, and keyword optimization of the page&#8217;s content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/what-is-on-page-seo-services\/\">on-page SEO practice<\/a> is creating SEO-friendly URLs for every page. If you are using a CMS like WordPress, then the CMS uses the default URL structure which is not SEO-friendly. You can change the default SEO structure and create a custom URL that can include the main keywords.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than this, focus on optimizing the images of the website to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/why-page-load-speed-is-important-for-your-website\/\">improve the loading speed<\/a>.

The faster the website loads, the better ranking it gets as the bounce rate reduces significantly. You can use free speed test tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google PageSpeed Insights<\/a> to check whether the website loads faster on both desktop and mobile versions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Google and other search engines are focusing on mobile-first indexing, it becomes important to focus on making the website optimized for mobile devices.

While you buy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/seo-services.html\">SEO services<\/a>, ask the agency what off-page strategies they will perform on your website to drive relevant traffic and audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the industry you work in, your agency will suggest custom off-page strategies and once you are satisfied with their work, you can buy SEO services to begin the off-page optimization. Having a robust off-page plan is crucial as it&#8217;s the foundation for creating brand authority among the competition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These were the basic Website SEO services that you need to focus on.

From making routine tasks simple to providing customized search results, AI is all set to change how we see mobile apps today. You must have noticed that many of the apps you use come with a built-in recommendation system that suggests similar apps depending on your behavior patterns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sense of personalization makes you feel important and helps increase engagement levels too. Whether you want recommendations for shopping or movies, AI can predict your likes and dislikes pretty well based on what other people like you prefer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Chatbots\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Chatbots<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As everyone already knows, messaging apps have become extremely popular over the past few years. People tend to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/chatbot-and-its-impact-on-digital-marketing\/\">enjoy conversing with chatbots<\/a> because they feel like talking to a human being. They can share thoughts and be part of communities without disclosing their real identity because it brings in a sense of anonymity too which makes it fun for them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chatbots are programmed mainly for customer satisfaction where businesses can send important updates quickly and easily. In other words, chatbots work as a bridge between the customer and the business so that everyone knows what they are up to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Wearables\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Wearables<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not a hidden fact anymore that technology has found its way into our clothing. From smartwatches to fitness trackers, everything can now be connected to a mobile phone. In fact, from 2013-2023 wearable devices are expected to witness a CAGR of 18%. It means this market won&#8217;t be slowing down anytime soon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as mobile app developments are concerned, it is expected that more businesses will come up with their apps for wearable gadgets in the future because there is no denying how convenient it is to use them while going about your daily chores. Not only does it make you healthy but also helps you stay updated with all the recent happenings in your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Responsive_Web_Design_RWD\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Responsive Web Design (RWD)<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are using a laptop or a mobile phone, people expect your website to load quickly on any device regardless of the annoying popups that they need to dismiss for accessing your content. That is why it has become important for businesses across the globe to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/responsive-web-design-services.html\">consider responsive web design<\/a> since it makes it easier for users to navigate through their websites.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It keeps everyone happy because there is no additional cost involved and helps make online transactions quite easy as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_iBeacon_Technology\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. iBeacon Technology<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since we already have radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology available at our disposal, this opens up opportunities for businesses to come up with innovative ideas. For instance, iBeacon is capable of providing relevant information to people based on their location. You might have already come across this feature where you get messages related to your surroundings when you are in a shopping mall for example.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem quite similar to geofencing, iBeacon is better as it can also provide additional messages depending on where you are right now. and what mood you are in. This makes it easier for businesses to connect with their customers in an unobtrusive manner because there is no need for any app downloads every time they want something new from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Augmented_Reality_AR\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Augmented Reality (AR)<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, we have been talking about how technology can be used for our convenience but AR marks a turning point because it brings together the real and virtual world. It superimposes digital images over real-world objects and makes them appear in front of your eyes. Right now, we mostly get to see this feature on mobile devices like smartphones where you get information alongside whatever object you happen to look at.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there is no denying that AR has many other practical applications such as helping architects visualize the building they want to construct. That is why businesses across different industries are expected to utilize this innovative idea in their next set of mobile apps. It has become an important part of the ever-growing mobile app development trends which will bring in more opportunities for everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Gamification_of_Apps\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Gamification of Apps<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, there have been a lot of changes in the way we use apps. For instance, there are apps for checking out quirky hairstyles and makeup tutorials right next to games that can keep you hooked for hours together. This is what businesses refer to as gamification where customers get a chance to interact with their favorite brands by playing exciting new games on their mobiles. It gives people a reason to come back again and again because who doesn&#8217;t like being rewarded every once in a while?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With mobile app developments bringing in such interesting changes in the way we interact with people, it is no wonder that businesses are looking forward to working on their existing apps and coming up with fresh ideas which can be used by everyone. That is why this particular trend is expected to grow at a rapid pace because let&#8217;s face it; who doesn&#8217;t like playing games when they get a chance?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Cloud-based_Apps\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Cloud-based Apps<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses might have woken up to the potential of mobile app developments but they will soon realize its limitations as well. With limited storage space available on mobiles, there would come a time when users start running out of memory because most applications tend to use more than 50% of the total memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why cloud-based apps are expected to make their presence felt soon because there will be no need for users to download anything locally on their phones. All one needs to do is access it from the internet and this should make life easier for everyone involved.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9_Machine_Learning\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Machine Learning<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you talk about the world of mobile app development, machine learning is one name that can never be ignored because it is one of the most popular trends. It helps businesses understand what their customers are looking for and this makes it easier for them to come up with new ideas on how they can improve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is pretty much like Siri already being part of our lives as we know who to contact even when we don&#8217;t remember someone&#8217;s number. However, developers have made sure that the entire process works seamlessly so there isn&#8217;t any need to worry about your data being misused.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"10_Privacy\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Privacy<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more people using mobile phones, there are chances that their data can be accessed by third parties. That is why the importance of privacy has grown over the years which will bring this particular mobile app development trend into everyone&#8217;s lives before 2024.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has already become a growing concern for both businesses and users because they want to keep things secure so that no one can access the information which should ideally remain personal. So, this is another reason why it might become a part of the overall mobile app development trends because people want to feel safe and secure when they shop online or download new apps on their phones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wrapping_up\"><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrapping up!<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the top ten mobile app development trends that you need to consider in 2024 and gain an edge.

The goal of ORM is to protect and improve the reputation of a business or individual by suppressing negative search results, promoting positive content, and improving overall sentiment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In this process<\/strong>, businesses can also take proactive steps to prevent future damage to their reputation. ORM is a holistic and long-term approach that requires businesses to continuously monitor their online presence and take immediate action to address any negative sentiment.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_is_Online_Reputation_Management_Important\"><\/span>Why is Online Reputation Management Important?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13394\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/08073853\/Online-Reputation-Management-Important.jpg\" alt=\"Online Reputation Management Important\" width=\"997\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/08073853\/Online-Reputation-Management-Important.jpg 997w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/08073853\/Online-Reputation-Management-Important-300x130.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/08073853\/Online-Reputation-Management-Important-768x332.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why ORM is important for businesses. First and foremost, ORM can help businesses protect their image and reputation online. ORM can help businesses with:<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"i_Build_higher_brand_credibility\"><\/span>i) Build higher brand credibility:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When businesses focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/online-reputation-management-strategy\/\">ORM<\/a>, they are more likely to create positive sentiments about their brand online. This can help build higher brand credibility and make it easier for customers to trust the business.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ii_Reduce_the_impact_of_negative_publicity\"><\/span>ii) Reduce the impact of negative publicity:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>No business is immune to negative publicity and even the most well-run businesses can make mistakes. ORM can help businesses reduce the impact of negative publicity by suppressing negative search results and promoting positive content.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"iii_Generate_more_leads_and_sales\"><\/span>iii) Generate more leads and sales:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A good online reputation can help businesses attract more customers and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/lead-generation-tips\/\">generate more leads and sales<\/a>.

Today, word-of-mouth has gone digital and customers are more likely to read online reviews and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/testimonial.html\">testimonials<\/a> before doing business with a company.

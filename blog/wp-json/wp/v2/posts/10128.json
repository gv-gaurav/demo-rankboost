The marketing teams are using this method in order to deal with community management, including identifying the pain points for customers. They can also use it to issue response from the company regarding comments, complaints and questions. It can also be used to see the feedback that could be used to help set their brand apart as well as their products and services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_is_it_Important\"><\/span><b><i>Why is it Important?<\/i><\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many digital channels that are increasing daily and these are the newest ways for consumers to be able to share their experiences and feedback. Social listening now allows businesses to see what they are saying and to deal with it immediately. It can also help them to decide which offerings would be appealing to certain groups, especially those that are unhappy, including in services and products or advertisements and even content.

Once you have found the mentions of your business, then you can use those mentions to create links. Ensure that you are using the Boolean method for searching so that you can find the mentions and then use them to make links that go back to your company. This is important since you want to get all of the links that you can possibly find without having to do much work. This should be done for every mention that you get because not everyone is going to link back to your site or even take the time and effort to do that for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Monitor_the_New_Links\"><\/span><b><i>Monitor the New Links<\/i><\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days you need to make sure that you are keeping track of all of the links that are going back to your site. This is important when it comes to your marketing needs and you want to ensure that the links you are getting are from the top quality sites. When you implement social listening you can find out the new links immediately, so make sure that you are doing this. You can pick and choose how you want the searches to be done and if you want social media sites to be excluded from the results. Monitoring the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/link-building-services.html\">links will help you<\/a> to see what is being said so that you aren\u2019t missing anything else that might be said through comments, posts and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Brand_Reputation\"><\/span><b><i>Brand Reputation<\/i><\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to social listening you might not think that the <\/span><a href=\"\/blog\/protect-your-brand-reputation-with-reputation-management-services\/\"><b>brand reputation is important<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it is. You would want to know what the readers and viewers are seeing and writing so that you can counteract the reviews if required. You don\u2019t want to harm your rank either, so ensure that you are taking care of the reviews and that you are responding to any negative ones. You can use a sentiment tool that is inbuilt into the SEO technology that would help to point out any spikes that are occurring so you can deal with them before they get too bad. This is the best way that you can use the social listening tool to find out what others are saying and then responding to the feedback that is negative.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Learning_From_Competition\"><\/span><b><i>Learning From Competition<\/i><\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many ways that you can ensure that your competition isn\u2019t getting the leg up on you, including making sure that you are following them. Once you have figured out their strategy, or at least part of it, then you can make sure that you are learning from them.

If you are aware of what people are saying, then you would be able to take care of it before it turns into a larger problem. Make sure that you are addressing the problems that people are saying happened and that you are responding directly to it. However, you have to be able to find the feedback in order to do that, so make sure to use the methods listed above to find it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would want to ensure that you are aware of how you can get ahead ahead when it comes to social listening. You would need to make sure that your brand reputation is staying at the top of the game and that you are listening for any spikes that would mention your brand.

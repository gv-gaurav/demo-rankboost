It is not that revenue is not of enough significance, but there are other crucial aspects too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">According to current trends, customer engagement is measured and assessed by quite a few metrics. Conversions, clicks, traffic, and share are some of the prime indicators of customer engagement. But those are simply considerations made by marketers. In reality, they seem to be of little use in measuring engagement or customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">Therefore, the emphasis is on ensuring unsurpassed experiences for customers. Businesses must embrace customer-centric approaches and give weight age to client satisfaction. Their target must be towards aligning sales goal with customer support, thus reaping dual benefits.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">How about referring to the following points for a reality check?<\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_69 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title \" >Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" aria-label=\"Toggle Table of Content\"><span class=\"ez-toc-js-icon-con\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"eztoc-hide\" style=\"display:none;\">Toggle<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-icon-toggle-span\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"\/blog\/customer-engagement-ever-changing-world\/#1_Ensure_%E2%80%98Real_Experiences\" title=\"1.

The same report points at the increasing eagerness of customers to get information on their chosen goods and services. That does not necessarily mean businesses can keep on targeting their ad materials to potential customers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">Don\u2019t ever consider your B2B customers to be inanimate objects or zombies.

Don\u2019t keep on pestering them about reviews.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"justify\">Try not to embarrass or irritate them by featuring their chosen product ads on each and every site visited by them.

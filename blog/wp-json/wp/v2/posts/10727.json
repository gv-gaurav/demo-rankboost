It is surely rewarding but certainly not easy. Especially when you are a woman &amp; your work involves around lots &amp; lots of men,\u00a0kids responsibility, managing home,\u00a0balancing people&#8217;s expectations &amp; last but not the least,\u00a0taking out time for self healing &amp; self care, don&#8217;t expect it all to be a cake walk. Many a times, you will be challenged- Directly \/ Indirectly, your position, your presence of mind, your existence, your parenting style, your relationship status &#8211; everything will be questioned so be ready to face it all.

Stay Positive, Keep moving &amp; one day when you look back, you will be so proud of yourself &amp; your team.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Keep_Walking\"><\/span>Keep Walking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This is my favorite tagline from &#8220;Jonnie Walker&#8221;. These 2 words fill me with so much of encouragement &amp; self motivation. No matter if the house is a mess, no matter the meals is not ready yet, no matter if you are not been understood or supported, If you had a reason to get started, don&#8217;t stop now, just keep walking as gradually things will get better, routines will come into existence\u00a0&amp; you will achieve the goal eventually.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Dont_Be_Competitive_like_literally\"><\/span>Don&#8217;t Be Competitive (like literally<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Not everyone has the same goal, Not everyone has the same situations, similar motivational levels etc. So, please don&#8217;t pull anyone down. Just define your own goals &amp; work towards them.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Balance\"><\/span>Balance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>I am a Liberan &amp; I so love this quality in my own self (self praise ;)). I aim for Work-life balance. I want to enjoy my life as much as I want to work. I want to party like crazy as much as I like to be super busy &amp; super productive at work. I like it &amp; I am very grateful for the opportunity where I can work towards this balance.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Reward\"><\/span>Reward<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>No matter what your goals are, no matter how big or small they are, do reward yourself at the end of achieving each goal. Cherish, Be grateful &amp; Rewards yourself. Life is too short to bother others or pull them down. Let&#8217;s mind our own business &amp; create our own happiness.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Happiness_is_a_state_of_mind\"><\/span>Happiness is a state of mind<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We can be ahead of 200 companies but still behind 10 companies &amp; this should not make us grumpy. We are certainly happy to be where we are, very proud of our little achievements &amp; want to cherish every step we take to move closer to our goals. Happiness can only be felt when you have done ethical business &amp; no harm to others around you. So, make that conscious decision.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-10735 size-medium alignleft\" style=\"width: 300px !important; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/ezranking.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com\/ezrankings\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/07123530\/IMG_8982-e1582523390956-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Mansi Rana\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"We_before_Me\"><\/span>We before Me<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One person can change the world&#8230;hmmm&#8230;.not really!

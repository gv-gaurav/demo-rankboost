In reality, FCP measures the actual time that is taken by a user of the website to see a visual response from the page he is trying to open. It the page loads fast then it will help in keeping the visitor engaged. If not the visitor shall lose interest and shall leave the page. Load time will be very fast i.e. less than 0.4 seconds. This is the reason why FCP SEO is necessary. Hopefully, this information should provide an answer to questions such as &#8216;What is FCP in page speed?&#8217; and &#8216;What is FCP SEO?&#8217;<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong> DOM Content Loaded (DCL):<\/strong> DCL measures the time when the HTML document has been completely loaded and read. This exactly doesn\u2019t mean that the web page has loaded, it just means that the main HTML of the page has been loaded completely. The page has to then finish loading the images and stylesheets to make the page fully accessible to the user.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Category_Distribution_%E2%80%93\"><\/span>Category Distribution \u2013<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus FCP and DCL are both important factors for determining whether the page is Fast, Average or Slow. These two matrices &#8211; FCP and DCL understand the performance of your web page.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Fast:<\/strong> The median value of the metric is in the fastest third of all page loads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Slow:<\/strong> The median value of the metric is in the lowest third of all page loads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Average:<\/strong> The median value of the metric is in the middle third of all page loads.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By following the below-mentioned points we can <strong><a href=\"\/blog\/why-page-load-speed-is-important-for-your-website\/\">improve the page speed<\/a><\/strong> (PSIs:<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Clutter_Control\"><\/span>Clutter Control:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A website is like anything else, it works a lot better when it is organized and not dumped with clutters.

Loading of the non-cached content slows things down. W3 total cache or WP Rocket are some of the websites for caching.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Minify_Resources\"><\/span>Minify Resources:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Google doesn\u2019t prefer when the JavaScript or HTML files are too large. They tend to downgrade your site as unnecessary codes affect largely the browser behavior. Thus minifying the resources shall help in improved page speed insights.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Optimize_Images\"><\/span>Optimize Images:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One should not only compress the images but also specify the dimension. When a visitor visits your site the browser has to determine how exactly to display your content. If you haven\u2019t already specified the size of images the browser has to calculate itself and thus will lead to more time taking.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Prioritize_Visible_Content\"><\/span>Prioritize Visible Content:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is always recommended to show the main content of the site at the top and other related documents later.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Improve_Server_Response_Time\"><\/span>Improve Server Response Time:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Poor web hosting, web traffic, etc. may be a cause for slow response time. Moreover, many poor plugins can also be a cause of the slow response time of the site.

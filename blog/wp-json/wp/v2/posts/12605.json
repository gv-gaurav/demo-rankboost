A single, simple negative review is likely harmless. But with more search, within minutes, a consumer can know about a business with search and social media. If the online reputation of a business, doesn&#8217;t impress them, they are more than likely to avoid doing interacting with that business. So, ORM helps a business get standing on the web and establish trust and authority within the industry, with potential and current customers.

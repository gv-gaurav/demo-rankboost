Type of app:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The cost to develop a mobile app also depends on the type of app you\u2019re building. For instance, a gaming app will require more resources and time to develop than a simple utility app. In addition, the complexity of the design and features will also influence the cost.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_The_number_of_screens_and_wireframes\"><\/span>3. The number of screens and wireframes:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The number of screens and wireframes required to build a mobile app is another factor that influences the cost. Apps with more features, more screens, and more complex designs will require higher development costs. Screen refers to the number of user interface screens needed to complete the app and wireframes refer to the visual representation of how each screen will look.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_Technology_stack\"><\/span>4. Technology stack:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The technology stack used to develop the app will also affect the cost. For instance, apps built with native code tend to be more expensive than those built with cross-platform tools. The cost of the technology stack may also vary depending on the platform you\u2019re building for (e.g. iOS or Android).<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wrapping_up\"><\/span>Wrapping up!<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Hire mobile app development experts from EZ Rankings to create a powerful, secure and feature-rich mobile app for your business.

Every marketer is aiming for that top spot for maximum visibility.<\/p>\n<p>However, Google ad rank quality score depends on several factors such as bid amount, ad quality, user search intent, competitiveness, ad extensions used, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that ad rank Google ads don&#8217;t always appear before organic search results. The position of the paid ad can vary on the search engine result page.<\/p>\n<p>By participating in a bid ad auction, Google determines the ad position. The ad rank determines the position of the ad and its eligibility. The position of the ad depends on several factors as discussed above such as bid amount, overall ad quality, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The positions of the ads are decided based on these factors and the ad at the highest position has done well on all the mentioned factors.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Ad_Rank_Is_Determined\"><\/span>How Ad Rank Is Determined?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that both Google ad rank and Google ad rank quality score change each time the ad is eligible to appear and thus, the ad position fluctuates.

The actual amount paid is much less, and this bid amount can be changed anytime.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The quality of the ads(including landing page):<\/strong> What Google looks for is ad relevancy when it comes to Google ad rank. Is the Google ad that&#8217;s appearing relevant to the user or not. Moreover, on which page does the user land after clicking on the ad? Is that relevant to the ad and does it answer user search intent? All these questions answer whether an ad has a respectable Google ad rank quality score or not.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ad Rank Thresholds:<\/strong> Ad Rank Thresholds are a group of standards that should be met for an ad to appear in the paid search results. It includes overall ad quality, user search intent, ad position, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Competitiveness:<\/strong> If the two ads have similar ad rank, then they both have a chance of appearing. However, as the difference grows larger, the one with the higher ad rank quality score has a higher chance of winning, but that may also mean that they have a higher CPC or cost-per-click. Thus, consistent, premium quality of ads can overcome the competition at any point.<\/li>\n<li><strong>User Search Intent:<\/strong> Google ads ad rank is highly affected by the context of the search which is why they fluctuate each time a new search is conducted. \u00a0Moreover, the location of the searcher, the type of device used, the time of the search, etc. are some additional factors that are taken into consideration.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ad Extensions And Ad Format:<\/strong> In ad rank Google ads, it&#8217;s possible to display additional information such as phone numbers and other relevant links. These are known as ad extensions and how you use them also affects the Google ads ad rank.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>In Simple, <\/strong>Ad Rank is calculated using your bid amount, your auction-time ad quality (including expected clickthrough rate {CTR}, ad relevance, and landing page experience), the Ad Rank thresholds, the competitiveness of an auction,<\/p>\n<p>the context of the person&#8217;s search (for example, the person&#8217;s location, device, the time of search, nature of the search terms, the other ads and search results that show on the page, and other user signals and attributes), and the expected impact of extensions and other ad formats.<\/p>\n<pre><strong>Also Know:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ezrankings.com\/blog\/ppc-strategy-trends\/\">PPC Strategy &amp; Trends to Watch in 2022<\/a><\/pre>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Does_Quality_Of_An_Ad_Matter\"><\/span>Why Does Quality Of An Ad Matter?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A high-quality ad has numerous advantages over a low-quality ad. These are some of the reasons why ad quality matters:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>To satisfy ad auction eligibility:<\/strong> The ad should have that much quality to pass the Ad Rank Thresholds. This decides whether the ad is eligible to appear or not. Hence, poorly formed ads are always rejected by Google.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Real CPC:<\/strong> Often, high-quality ads have lower CPC. So, if your ads satisfy user intent, then you&#8217;ll pay a lower amount for each click.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ad Position:<\/strong> Better-quality ads will always be placed at a higher position than second-rate ads. With a better ad position, the ad can appear towards the top of the search results page, offering better visibility and thus, more clicks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eligibility For Ad Extensions:<\/strong> A higher ad rank Google score and quality score opens doors for ad extensions. It&#8217;s the ad rank that decides whether an ad is eligible to be displayed with ad extensions or not.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Hence, developing a relevant ad that answers user search intent is the best option. Well-made ads also lead to better Google ads ad rank and quality score. Thus, lower cost, \u00a0better online visibility, and higher ad positions are some of the benefits of creating premium ads.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Ad_Rank_Google_The_Methods_To_Improve_It\"><\/span>Ad Rank Google: The Methods To Improve It<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know the factors and benefits of ad rank Google, you can now easily understand the factors that improve ad rank. The major improvements that should be implemented to better ad rank are:<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Improve_Ad_Relevance\"><\/span>1. Improve Ad Relevance<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Ad relevance is a primary factor when it comes to ad rank Google ads. The better the ad at solving user search intent, the higher the ad relevance.<\/p>\n<p>To make ads more relevant, start by analyzing your copy and the keywords that you&#8217;re bidding on. The user&#8217;s search keyword can also be included in the description and title of the ad.<\/p>\n<p>One of the better ways is to initiate responsive search ads that test and automate different ad combinations based on user search intent. Over time, Google learns which headline and description to present and what performs best.<\/p>\n<p>With responsive search ads, a user can test, or optimize different ad titles and descriptions that are presented by Google based on the user search intent.<\/p>\n<p>However, the focus should be on resolving user intent instead of stuffing keywords. It should be about creating meaningful, helpful ads that can satisfy user search intent.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, being a problem solver is what&#8217;s expected from ad creators for a better ad rank Google. So, the better your ad is at resolving a query, the higher its relevance.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_Quality_Ad_Extension_Content\"><\/span>2. Quality Ad Extension Content<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Ad extensions are essential for a quality Google ads ad rank. These ad extensions play a crucial role in increasing CTR which in turn boosts ad rank.<\/p>\n<p>The title and description of an ad are limited by character count. However, that can be compensated by ad extensions that can provide additional information about a business depending on the extension used.<\/p>\n<p>Ensure not to add ad extensions for the sake of using them. Utilize them wisely as they can help resolve user search queries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some of the available ad extensions are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>Price<\/li>\n<li>Structured Snippet<\/li>\n<li>Promotion<\/li>\n<li>Call and more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With so many ad extensions, it can often become confusing which one to add. Technically, for ad rank Google ads, adding extensions that fit your campaign goals should be utilized.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, a local business can utilize local extensions if they are willing to add more in-store visits. Hence, aligning ad extensions with goals and using them with a purpose will boost ad rank as they make an ad more informative.<\/p>\n<h4><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Optimize_Landing_Pages\"><\/span>3. Optimize Landing Pages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Landing pages should not be underestimated as they are often the most important part of increasing conversion rate through paid ads. Any user who&#8217;s ever clicked on an ad, only to find a dull and uninformative landing page knows how important ad landing pages are.<\/p>\n<p>They should provide you with the information required and are a crucial part of the user experience.<\/p>\n\t<section class=\"pack-call-to-action first\">\n\t  <div class=\"container\">\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"col-md-12 text-center\">\n\t\t\t<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"First_impression_is_the_last_impression\"><\/span>First impression is the last impression<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Make sure to make an impactful one for your business with our cutting-edge web development services.

This pinpoints the information that audiences care about, thus, making the ads more precise. Moreover, adopting this also reduces bounce rate and unnecessary visits to a website.<\/p>\n<p>Having way too many 301 redirects can also propose a problem. Always ensure that the URL in your ads will directly link to the final page instead of going through http to https or https:\/\/ www to only https.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, make it easy for the visitor on your website to satisfy user intent. Don&#8217;t make it a cumbersome task which is why website internal linking also plays a crucial role.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google ad rank relies on several factors and understanding those is crucial to know how to increase the ad rank.
